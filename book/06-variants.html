    <h1>Variants</h1>

    <p>
      Variant types are one of the most useful features of OCaml and
      also one of the most unusual. They let you represent data that
      may take on multiple different forms, where each form is marked
      by an explicit tag. As we'll see, when combined with pattern
      matching, variants give you a powerful way of representing
      complex data and of organizing the case-analysis on that
      information.

      <idx>variant types/usefulness of</idx>
      <idx id="DTvar">datatypes/variant types</idx></p>

    <p>
      The basic syntax of a variant type declaration is as follows:

      <idx>variant types/basic syntax of</idx></p>

    <link rel="import" href="code/variants/variant.syntax"/>

    <p>
      Each row essentially represents a case of the variant. Each
      case has an associated tag and may optionally have a sequence
      of fields, where each field has a specified type.</p>

    <p>
      Let's consider a concrete example of how variants can be
      useful. Almost all terminals support a set of eight basic
      colors, and we can represent those colors using a variant. Each
      color is declared as a simple tag, with pipes used to separate
      the different cases. Note that variant tags must be
      capitalized.</p>

    <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="0.5"/>

    <p>
      The following function uses pattern matching to convert
      a <code>basic_color</code> to a corresponding integer. The
      exhaustiveness checking on pattern matches means that the
      compiler will warn us if we miss a color:</p>

    <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="1"/>

    <p>
      Using the preceding function, we can generate escape codes to
      change the color of a given string displayed in a terminal:</p>

    <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="2"/>

    <p>
      On most terminals, that word "Blue" will be rendered in
      blue.</p>

    <p>
      In this example, the cases of the variant are simple tags with
      no associated data. This is substantively the same as the
      enumerations found in languages like C and Java. But as we'll
      see, variants can do considerably more than represent a simple
      enumeration. As it happens, an enumeration isn't enough to
      effectively describe the full set of colors that a modern
      terminal can display. Many terminals, including the
      venerable <code>xterm</code>, support 256 different colors,
      broken up into the following groups:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> <p>The eight basic colors, in regular and bold
	  versions</p> </li>

      <li> <p>A 6 × 6 × 6 RGB color cube</p> </li>

      <li> <p>A 24-level grayscale ramp</p> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We'll also represent this more complicated color space as a
      variant, but this time, the different tags will have arguments
      that describe the data available in each case. Note that
      variants can have multiple arguments, which are separated
      by <code>*</code>s:</p>

    <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="3"/>

    <p>
      Once again, we'll use pattern matching to convert a color to a
      corresponding integer. But in this case, the pattern matching
      does more than separate out the different cases; it also allows
      us to extract the data associated with each tag:</p>

    <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="4"/>

    <p>Now, we can print text using the full set of available
    colors:</p>

      <h1>Catch-All Cases and Refactoring</h1>

      <p>
	OCaml's type system can act as a refactoring tool, warning
	you of places where your code needs to be updated to match an
	interface change. This is particularly valuable in the
	context of variants.

	<idx>errors/catch-all cases and refactoring</idx>
	<idx>pattern matching/catch-all cases</idx>
	<idx>functional updates</idx>
	<idx>refactoring</idx>
	<idx>variant types/catch-all cases and refactoring</idx></p>

      <p>Consider what would happen if we were to change the
      definition of <code>color</code> to the following:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/catch_all.mlt" part="1"/>

      <p>We've essentially broken out the <code>Basic</code> case
      into two cases, <code>Basic</code> and <code>Bold</code>, and
      <code>Basic</code> has changed from having two arguments to
      one. <code>color_to_int</code> as we wrote it still expects
      the old structure of the variant, and if we try to compile
      that same code again, the compiler will notice the
      discrepancy:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/catch_all.mlt" part="2"/>

      <p>Here, the compiler is complaining that the <code>Basic</code>
      tag is used with the wrong number of arguments. If we fix that,
      however, the compiler will flag a second problem, which is that
      we haven't handled the new <code>Bold</code> tag:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/catch_all.mlt" part="3"/>

      <p>Fixing this now leads us to the correct
      implementation:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/catch_all.mlt" part="4"/>

      <p>As we've seen, the type errors identified the things that
      needed to be fixed to complete the refactoring of the code.
      This is fantastically useful, but for it to work well and
      reliably, you need to write your code in a way that maximizes
      the compiler's chances of helping you find the bugs. To this
      end, a useful rule of thumb is to avoid catch-all cases in
      pattern matches.</p>

      <p>Here's an example that illustrates how catch-all cases
      interact with exhaustion checks. Imagine we wanted a version
      of <code>color_to_int</code> that works on older terminals by
      rendering the first 16 colors (the eight
      <code>basic_color</code>s in regular and bold) in the normal
      way, but renders everything else as white. We might have
      written the function as follows:

      <idx>exhaustion checks</idx></p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/catch_all.mlt" part="5"/>

      <p>If we then applied the same fix we did above, we would have
      ended up with this.</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/catch_all.mlt" part="6"/>

      <p>
	Because of the catch-all case, we'll no longer be warned about
	missing the <code>Bold</code> case. This highlights the value
	of avoiding catch-all cases, since they effectively suppress
	exhaustiveness checking.</p>

      <h1>Combining Records and Variants</h1>

      <p>The term <em>algebraic data types</em> is often used to
      describe a collection of types that includes variants,
      records, and tuples. Algebraic data types act as a peculiarly
      useful and powerful language for describing data. At the
      heart of their utility is the fact that they combine two
      different kinds of types: <em>product types</em>, like tuples
      and records, which combine multiple different types together
      and are mathematically similar to Cartesian products; and
      <em>sum types</em>, like variants, which let you combine
      multiple different possibilities into one type, and are
      mathematically similar to disjoint unions.<idx id="RECvartyp">records/and variant types</idx><idx>sum
      types</idx><idx>product types</idx><idx>datatypes/algebraic
      types</idx><idx>algebraic data types</idx><idx id="VARTYPrec">variant types/and records</idx></p>

      <p>Algebraic data types gain much of their power from the
      ability to construct layered combinations of sums and
      products. Let's see what we can achieve with this by
      revisiting the logging server types that were described in
      <a href="05-records.html#records" data-type="xref">Records</a>. We'll start by reminding ourselves of the
      definition of <code>Log_entry.t</code>:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/logger.mlt" part="1"/>

      <p>This record type combines multiple pieces of data into one
      value. In particular, a single <code>Log_entry.t</code> has a
      <code>session_id</code> <em>and</em> a <code>time</code>
      <em>and</em> an <code>important</code> flag <em>and</em> a
      <code>message</code>. More generally, you can think of record
      types as conjunctions. Variants, on the other hand, are
      disjunctions, letting you represent multiple possibilities,
      as in the following example:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/logger.mlt" part="2"/>

      <p>A <code>client_message</code> is a <code>Logon</code>
      <em>or</em> a <code>Heartbeat</code> <em>or</em> a
      <code>Log_entry</code>. If we want to write code that
      processes messages generically, rather than code specialized
      to a fixed message type, we need something like
      <code>client_message</code> to act as one overarching type
      for the different possible messages. We can then match on the
      <code>client_message</code> to determine the type of the
      particular message being dealt with.</p>

      <p>You can increase the precision of your types by using
      variants to represent differences between types, and records
      to represent shared structure. Consider the following
      function that takes a list of <code>client_message</code>s
      and returns all messages generated by a given user. The code
      in question is implemented by folding over the list of
      messages, where the accumulator is a pair of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The set of session identifiers for the user that have
          been seen thus far</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The set of messages so far that are associated with
          the user</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here's the concrete code:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/logger.mlt" part="3"/>

      <p>Note that we take advantage of the fact that the type of the
      record <code>m</code> is known in the above code, so we don't
      have to qualify the record fields by the module they come
      from. <em>e.g.</em>, we write <code>m.user</code> instead
      of <code>m.Logon.user</code>. </p>

      <p>One annoyance of the above code is that the logic for
      determining the session ID is somewhat repetitive, contemplating
      each of the possible message types (including
      the <code>Logon</code> case, which isn't actually possible at
      that point in the code) and extracting the session ID in each
      case. This per-message-type handling seems unnecessary, since
      the session ID works the same way for all of message types.</p>

      <p>We can improve the code by refactoring our types to
      explicitly reflect the information that's shared between the
      different messages. The first step is to cut down the
      definitions of each per-message record to contain just the
      information unique to that record:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/logger.mlt" part="4"/>

      <p>We can then define a variant type that combines these
      types:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/logger.mlt" part="5"/>

      <p>Separately, we need a record that contains the fields that
      are common across all messages:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/logger.mlt" part="6"/>

      <p>A full message can then be represented as a pair of
      a <code>Common.t</code> and a <code>details</code>. Using this,
      we can rewrite our preceding example as follows. Note that we
      add extra type annotations so that OCaml recognizes the record
      fields correctly. Otherwise, we'd need to qualify them
      explicitly.</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/logger.mlt"
	    part="7"/>

      <p>As you can see, the code for extracting the session ID has
      been replaced with the simple
      expression <code>common.session_id</code>.</p>

      <p>In addition, this design allows us to grab the specific
      message and dispatch code to handle just that message type. In
      particular, while we use the type <code>Common.t *
      details</code> to represent an arbitrary message, we can
      use <code>Common.t * Logon.t</code> to represent a logon
      message.  Thus, if we had functions for handling individual
      message types, we could write a dispatch function as
      follows:</p> <link rel="import"
      href="code/variants/logger.mlt" part="8"/>

      <p>
	And it's explicit at the type level that
	<code>handle_log_entry</code> sees only
	<code>Log_entry</code> messages, <code>handle_logon</code>
	sees only <code>Logon</code> messages, etc.

	<h2>Embedded records</h2>

	<p>If we don't need to be able to pass the record types
	  separately from the variant, then OCaml allows us to embed
	  the records directly into the variant.</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/variants/logger.mlt"
	      part="9"/>

	<p>Even though the type is different, we can
	  write <code>messages_for_user</code> in essentially the same
	  way we did before.</p>

	      part="10"/>

	<p>Variants with inline records are both more concise and more
	  efficient than having variants containing references to
	  free-standing record types, because they don't require a
	  separate allocated object for the contents of the
	  variant.</p>

	<p>The main downside is the obvious one, which is that an
	  inline record can't be treated as its own free-standing
	  object. And, as you can see below, OCaml will reject code
	  that tries to do so.</p>

    <section id="variants-and-recursive-data-structures" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>Variants and Recursive Data Structures</h1>

      <p>Another common application of variants is to represent
      tree-like recursive data structures. We'll show how this can
      be done by walking through the design of a simple Boolean
      expression language. Such a language can be useful anywhere
      you need to specify filters, which are used in everything
      from packet analyzers to mail clients.

	<idx>recursive data structures</idx>
	<idx>data structures/recursive</idx>
	<idx>variant types/and recursive data structures</idx></p>

      <p>An expression in this language will be defined by the
      variant <code>expr</code>, with one tag for each kind of
      expression we want to support:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/blang.mlt" part="0.5"/>

      <p>Note that the definition of the type <code>expr</code> is
      recursive, meaning that a <code>expr</code> may contain other
      <code>expr</code>s. Also, <code>expr</code> is parameterized
      by a polymorphic type <code>'a</code> which is used for
      specifying the type of the value that goes under the
      <code>Base</code> tag.</p>

      <p>The purpose of each tag is pretty straightforward.
      <code>And</code>, <code>Or</code>, and <code>Not</code> are
      the basic operators for building up Boolean expressions, and
      <code>Const</code> lets you enter the constants
      <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>

      <p>The <code>Base</code> tag is what allows you to tie the
      <code>expr</code> to your application, by letting you specify
      an element of some base predicate type, whose truth or
      falsehood is determined by your application. If you were
      writing a filter language for an email processor, your base
      predicates might specify the tests you would run against an
      email, as in the following example:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/blang.mlt" part="1"/>

      <p>Using the preceding code, we can construct a simple
      expression with <code>mail_predicate</code> as its base
      predicate:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/blang.mlt" part="2"/>

      <p>Being able to construct such expressions isn't enough; we
      also need to be able to evaluate them. Here's a function for
      doing just that:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/blang.mlt" part="3"/>

      <p>The structure of the code is pretty straightforward—we're
      just pattern matching over the structure of the data, doing
      the appropriate calculation based on which tag we see. To use
      this evaluator on a concrete example, we just need to write
      the <code>base_eval</code> function, which is capable of
      evaluating a base predicate.</p>

      <p>Another useful operation on expressions is simplification.
      The following is a set of simplifying construction functions
      that mirror the tags of an <code>expr</code>:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/blang.mlt" part="4"/>

      <p>We can now write a simplification routine that is based on
      the preceding functions.</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/blang.mlt" part="5"/>

      <p>We can apply this to a Boolean expression and see how good
      a job it does at simplifying it:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/blang.mlt" part="6"/>

      <p>Here, it correctly converted the <code>Or</code> branch to
      <code>Const true</code> and then eliminated the
      <code>And</code> entirely, since the <code>And</code> then
      had only one nontrivial component.</p>

      <p>There are some simplifications it misses, however. In
      particular, see what happens if we add a double negation
      in:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/blang.mlt" part="7"/>

      <p>It fails to remove the double negation, and it's easy to
      see why. The <code>not_</code> function has a catch-all case,
      so it ignores everything but the one case it explicitly
      considers, that of the negation of a constant. Catch-all
      cases are generally a bad idea, and if we make the code more
      explicit, we see that the missing of the double negation is
      more obvious:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/blang.mlt" part="8"/>

      <p>We can of course fix this by simply adding an explicit
      case for double negation:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/blang.mlt" part="9"/>

      <p>The example of a Boolean expression language is more than
      a toy. There's a module very much in this spirit in
      <code>Base</code> called <code>Blang</code> (short for
      "Boolean language"), and it gets a lot of practical use in a
      variety of applications. The simplification algorithm in
      particular is useful when you want to use it to specialize
      the evaluation of expressions for which the evaluation of
      some of the base predicates is already known.</p>

      <p>More generally, using variants to build recursive data
      structures is a common technique, and shows up everywhere
      from designing little languages to building complex data
      structures.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="polymorphic-variants" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>Polymorphic Variants</h1>

      <p>In addition to the ordinary variants we've seen so far,
      OCaml also supports so-called <em>polymorphic variants</em>.
      As we'll see, polymorphic variants are more flexible and
      syntactically more lightweight than ordinary variants, but
      that extra power comes at a cost.

	<idx>polymorphic variant types/basic syntax of</idx>
	<idx id="VARTYPpoly">variant types/polymorphic</idx></p>

      <p>Syntactically, polymorphic variants are distinguished from
      ordinary variants by the leading backtick. And unlike
      ordinary variants, polymorphic variants can be used without
      an explicit type declaration:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="6"/>

      <p>
	As you can see, polymorphic variant types are inferred
	automatically, and when we combine variants with different
	tags, the compiler infers a new type that knows about all of
	those tags. Note that in the preceding example, the tag name
	(e.g., <code>`Int</code>) matches the type name
	(<code>int</code>). This is a common convention in OCaml.

	<idx>polymorphic variant types/automatic inference of</idx></p>

      <p>The type system will complain if it sees incompatible uses
      of the same tag:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="7"/>

      <p>The <code>&gt;</code> at the beginning of the variant
      types above is critical because it marks the types as being
      open to combination with other variant types. We can read the
      type <code>[&gt; `Int of string | `Float of float]</code> as
      describing a variant whose tags include <code>`Int of
      string</code> and <code>`Float of float</code>, but may
      include more tags as well. In other words, you can roughly
      translate <code>&gt;</code> to mean: "these tags or
      more."</p>

      <p>OCaml will in some cases infer a variant type with
      <code>&lt;</code>, to indicate "these tags or less," as in
      the following example:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="8"/>

      <p>The <code>&lt;</code> is there
      because <code>is_positive</code> has no way of dealing with
      values that have tags other than <code>`Float of float</code>
      or <code>`Int of int</code>.</p>

      <p>We can think of these <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>
      markers as indications of upper and lower bounds on the tags
      involved. If the same set of tags are both an upper and a lower
      bound, we end up with an <em>exact</em> polymorphic variant
      type, which has neither marker. For example:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="9"/>

      <p>Perhaps surprisingly, we can also create polymorphic variant
      types that have different upper and lower bounds.  Note
      that <code>Ok</code> and <code>Error</code> in the following
      example come from the <code>Result.t</code> type
      from <code>Base</code>: <idx>polymorphic variant
      types/upper/lower bounds of</idx></p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="10"/>

      <p>Here, the inferred type states that the tags can be no more
      than <code>`Float</code>, <code>`Int</code>,
      and <code>`Not_a_number</code>, and must contain at
      least <code>`Float</code> and <code>`Int</code>. As you can
      already start to see, polymorphic variants can lead to fairly
      complex inferred types.</p>

      <section id="example-terminal-colors-redux" data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Example: Terminal Colors Redux</h2>

        <p>To see how to use polymorphic variants in practice, we'll
        return to terminal colors. Imagine that we have a new terminal
        type that adds yet more colors, say, by adding an alpha
        channel so you can specify translucent colors. We could model
        this extended set of colors as follows, using an ordinary
        variant:<idx>polymorphic variant types/vs.  ordinary

        like <code>color_to_int</code> for all of the old kinds of
        colors, with new logic only for handling colors that include
        an alpha channel. One might try to write such a function as
        follows.</p>

        <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="12"/>

        <p>The code looks reasonable enough, but it leads to a type
        error because <code>extended_color</code> and
        <code>color</code> are in the compiler's view distinct and
        unrelated types. The compiler doesn't, for example,
        recognize any equality between the <code>Basic</code> tag
        in the two types.</p>

        <p>What we want to do is to share tags between two different
        variant types, and polymorphic variants let us do this in a
        natural way. First, let's
        rewrite <code>basic_color_to_int</code>
        and <code>color_to_int</code> using polymorphic variants. The
        translation here is pretty straightforward:</p>

        <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="13"/>

        <p>Now we can try writing
        <code>extended_color_to_int</code>. The key issue with this
        code is that <code>extended_color_to_int</code> needs to
        invoke <code>color_to_int</code> with a narrower type,
        i.e., one that includes fewer tags. Written properly, this
        narrowing can be done via a pattern match. In particular,
        in the following code, the type of the variable
        <code>color</code> includes only the tags
        <code>`Basic</code>, <code>`RGB</code>, and
        <code>`Gray</code>, and not <code>`RGBA</code>:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="14"/>

        <p>
	  The preceding code is more delicately balanced than one
          might imagine. In particular, if we use a catch-all case
          instead of an explicit enumeration of the cases, the type is
          no longer narrowed, and so compilation fails:</p>

        <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="15"/>

        <div class="allow_break" data-type="note">
          <h1>Polymorphic Variants and Catch-all Cases</h1>

          <p>As we saw with the definition of
          <code>is_positive</code>, a <code>match</code> statement
          can lead to the inference of an upper bound on a variant
          type, limiting the possible tags to those that can be
          handled by the match. If we add a catch-all case to our
          <code>match</code> statement, we end up with a type with
          a lower bound:<idx>pattern matching/catch-all
          cases</idx><idx>catch-all cases</idx><idx>polymorphic
          variant types/and catch-all cases</idx></p>
          <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="16"/>

          <p>Catch-all cases are error-prone even with ordinary
          variants, but they are especially so with polymorphic
          variants. That's because you have no way of bounding what
          tags your function might have to deal with. Such code is
          particularly vulnerable to typos. For instance, if code
          that uses <code>is_positive_permissive</code> passes in
          <code>Float</code> misspelled as <code>Floot</code>, the
          erroneous code will compile without complaint:</p>
          <link rel="import" href="code/variants/main.mlt" part="17"/>

          <p>With ordinary variants, such a typo would have been
          caught as an unknown tag. As a general matter, one should
          be wary about mixing catch-all cases and polymorphic
          variants.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Let's consider how we might turn our code into a proper
        library with an implementation in an <code>ml</code> file
        and an interface in a separate <code>mli</code>, as we saw
        in <a href="04-files-modules-and-programs.html#files-modules-and-programs" data-type="xref">Files Modules And Programs</a>. Let's
        start with the <code>mli</code>:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/variants-termcol/terminal_color.mli"/>

        <p>Here, <code>extended_color</code> is defined as an
        explicit extension of <code>color</code>. Also, notice that
        we defined all of these types as exact variants. We can
        implement this library as follows:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/variants-termcol/terminal_color.ml"/>

        <p>In the preceding code, we did something funny to the
        definition of <code>extended_color_to_int</code> that
        underlines some of the downsides of polymorphic variants.
        In particular, we added some special-case handling for the
        color gray, rather than using <code>color_to_int</code>.
        Unfortunately, we misspelled <code>Gray</code> as
        <code>Grey</code>. This is exactly the kind of error that
        the compiler would catch with ordinary variants, but with
        polymorphic variants, this compiles without issue. All that
        happened was that the compiler inferred a wider type for
        <code>extended_color_to_int</code>, which happens to be
        compatible with the narrower type that was listed in the
        <code>mli</code>.</p>

        <p>If we add an explicit type annotation to the code itself
        (rather than just in the <code>mli</code>), then the
        compiler has enough information to warn us:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/variants-termcol-annotated/terminal_color.ml" part="1"/>

        <p>In particular, the compiler will complain that the
        <code>`Grey</code> case is unused:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/variants-termcol-annotated/jbuild"/>
        <link rel="import" href="code/variants-termcol-annotated/build.errsh"/>

        <p>Once we have type definitions at our disposal, we can
        revisit the question of how we write the pattern match that
        narrows the type. In particular, we can explicitly use the
        type name as part of the pattern match, by prefixing it
        with a <code>#</code>:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/variants-termcol-fixed/terminal_color.ml" part="1"/>

        <p>This is useful when you want to narrow down to a type
        whose definition is long, and you don't want the verbosity
        of writing the tags down explicitly in the match.</p>

        <h2>When to Use Polymorphic Variants</h2>

        <p>At first glance, polymorphic variants look like a strict
        improvement over ordinary variants. You can do everything
        that ordinary variants can do, plus it's more flexible and
        more concise. What's not to like?<idx>polymorphic variant
        types/vs. ordinary variants</idx><idx>polymorphic variant
        types/drawbacks of</idx></p>

        <p>In reality, regular variants are the more pragmatic
        choice most of the time. That's because the flexibility of
        polymorphic variants comes at a price. Here are some of the
        downsides:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Complexity</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>As we've seen, the typing rules for polymorphic
            variants are a lot more complicated than they are for
            regular variants. This means that heavy use of
            polymorphic variants can leave you scratching your head
            trying to figure out why a given piece of code did or
            didn't compile. It can also lead to absurdly long and
            hard to decode error messages. Indeed, concision at the
            value level is often balanced out by more verbosity at
            the type level.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Error-finding</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Polymorphic variants are type-safe, but the typing
            discipline that they impose is, by dint of its
            flexibility, less likely to catch bugs in your
            program.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Efficiency</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This isn't a huge effect, but polymorphic variants
            are somewhat heavier than regular variants, and OCaml
            can't generate code for matching on polymorphic
            variants that is quite as efficient as what it
            generated for regular variants.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>All that said, polymorphic variants are still a useful
        and powerful feature, but it's worth understanding their
        limitations and how to use them sensibly and modestly.</p>

        <p>Probably the safest and most common use case for
        polymorphic variants is where ordinary variants would be
        sufficient but are syntactically too heavyweight. For
        example, you often want to create a variant type for
        encoding the inputs or outputs to a function, where it's
        not worth declaring a separate type for it. Polymorphic
        variants are very useful here, and as long as there are
        type annotations that constrain these to have explicit,
        exact types, this tends to work well.</p>

        <p>Variants are most problematic exactly where you take
        full advantage of their power; in particular, when you take
        advantage of the ability of polymorphic variant types to
        overlap in the tags they support. This ties into OCaml's
        support for subtyping. As we'll discuss further when we
        cover objects in <a href="11-objects.html#objects" data-type="xref">Objects</a>, subtyping brings in a lot of
        complexity, and most of the time, that's complexity you
        want to avoid.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="VARTYPpoly">&nbsp;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="DTvar">&nbsp;</a></p>
