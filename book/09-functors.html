    <h1>Functors</h1>

    <p>
      Up until now, we've seen OCaml's modules play an important but
      limited role. In particular, we've seen them as a mechanism for
      organizing code into units with specified interfaces. But
      OCaml's module system can do much more than that, serving as a
      powerful tool for building generic code and structuring
      large-scale systems. Much of that power comes from functors.

      <idx>functors/benefits of</idx></p>

    <p>
      Functors are, roughly speaking, functions from modules to
      modules, and they can be used to solve a variety of
      code-structuring problems, including:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Dependency injection</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  Makes the implementations of some components of a system
          swappable. This is particularly useful when you want to mock
          up parts of your system for testing and simulation
          purposes.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Autoextension of modules</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  Functors give you a way of extending existing modules with
          new functionality in a standardized way. For example, you
          might want to add a slew of comparison operators derived
          from a base comparison function. To do this by hand would
          require a lot of repetitive code for each type, but functors
          let you write this logic just once and apply it to many
          different types.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Instantiating modules with state</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  Modules can contain mutable states, and that means that
          you'll occasionally want to have multiple instantiations of
          a particular module, each with its own separate and
          independent mutable state. Functors let you automate the
          construction of such modules.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      These are really just some of the uses that you can put
      functors to. We'll make no attempt to provide examples of all
      of the uses of functors here. Instead, this chapter will try to
      provide examples that illuminate the language features and
      design patterns that you need to master in order to use
      functors effectively.</p>

    <section id="a-trivial-example" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>A Trivial Example</h1>

      <p>
	Let's create a functor that takes a module containing a
	single integer variable <code>x</code> and returns a new
	module with <code>x</code> incremented by one. This is
	intended to serve as a way to walk through the basic
	mechanics of functors, even though it's not something you'd
	want to do in practice.

	<idx>functors/basic mechanics of</idx></p>

      <p>
	First, let's define a signature for a module that contains a
	single value of type <code>int</code>:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="0.5"/>

      <p>
	Now we can define our functor. We'll use
	<code>X_int</code> both to constrain the argument to the
	functor and to constrain the module returned by the
	functor:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="1"/>

      <p>One thing that immediately jumps out is that functors are
      more syntactically heavyweight than ordinary functions. For
      one thing, functors require explicit (module) type
      annotations, which ordinary functions do not. Technically,
      only the type on the input is mandatory, although in
      practice, you should usually constrain the module returned by
      the functor, just as you should use an <code>mli</code>, even
      though it's not mandatory.</p>

      <p>The following shows what happens when we omit the module
      type for the output of the functor:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="2"/>

      <p>We can see that the inferred module type of the output is
      now written out explicitly, rather than being a reference to
      the named signature <code>X_int</code>.</p>

      <p>We can use <code>Increment</code> to define new
      modules:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="3"/>

      <p>In this case, we applied <code>Increment</code> to a
      module whose signature is exactly equal to
      <code>X_int</code>. But we can apply <code>Increment</code>
      to any module that <em>satisfies</em> the interface
      <code>X_int</code>, in the same way that the contents of an
      <code>ml</code> file must satisfy the <code>mli</code>. That
      means that the module type can omit some information
      available in the module, either by dropping fields or by
      leaving some fields abstract. Here's an example:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="4"/>

      <p>The rules for determining whether a module matches a given
      signature are similar in spirit to the rules in an
      object-oriented language that determine whether an object
      satisfies a given interface. As in an object-oriented
      context, the extra information that doesn't match the
      signature you're looking for (in this case, the variable
      <code>y</code>) is simply ignored.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="a-bigger-example-computing-with-intervals" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>A Bigger Example: Computing with Intervals</h1>

      <p>Let's consider a more realistic example of how to use
      functors: a library for computing with intervals. Intervals
      are a common computational object, and they come up in
      different contexts and for different types. You might need to
      work with intervals of floating-point values or strings or
      times, and in each of these cases, you want similar
      operations: testing for emptiness, checking for containment,
      intersecting intervals, and so on.</p>

      <p>
	Let's see how to use functors to build a generic interval
	library that can be used with any type that supports a total
	ordering on the underlying set over which you want to build
	intervals.

	<idx>interval computation/generic library for</idx>
	<idx id="FUNCTinterv">functors/interval computation with</idx></p>

      <p>First we'll define a module type that captures the
      information we'll need about the endpoints of the intervals.
      This interface, which we'll call <code>Comparable</code>,
      contains just two things: a comparison function and the type
      of the values to be compared:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="5"/>

      <p>The comparison function follows the standard OCaml idiom
      for such functions, returning <code>0</code> if the two
      elements are equal, a positive number if the first element is
      larger than the second, and a negative number if the first
      element is smaller than the second. Thus, we could rewrite
      the standard comparison functions on top of
      <code>compare</code>.</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/compare_example.ml"/>

      <p>(This idiom is a bit of a historical error. It would be
      better if <code>compare</code> returned a variant with three
      cases for less than, greater than, and equal. But it's a
      well-established idiom at this point, and unlikely to
      change.)</p>

      <p>The functor for creating the interval module follows. We
      represent an interval with a variant type, which is either
      <code>Empty</code> or <code>Interval (x,y)</code>, where
      <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the bounds of the
      interval. In addition to the type, the body of the functor
      contains implementations of a number of useful primitives for
      interacting with intervals:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="6"/>

      <p>We can instantiate the functor by applying it to a module
      with the right signature. In the following code, rather than
      name the module first and then call the functor, we provide
      the functor input as an anonymous module:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="7"/>

      <p>If the input interface for your functor is aligned with
      the standards of the libraries you use, then you don't need
      to construct a custom module to feed to the functor. In this
      case, we can directly use the <code>Int</code> or
      <code>String</code> modules provided by Core_kernel:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="8"/>

      <p>This works because many modules in Core_kernel,
      including <code>Int</code> and <code>String</code>, satisfy an
      extended version of the <code>Comparable</code> signature
      described previously. Such standardized signatures are good
      practice, both because they make functors easier to use, and
      because they encourage standardization that makes your codebase
      easier to navigate.</p>

      <p>We can use the newly defined <code>Int_interval</code>
      module like any ordinary module:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="9"/>

      <p>This design gives us the freedom to use any comparison
      function we want for comparing the endpoints. We could, for
      example, create a type of integer interval with the order of
      the comparison reversed, as follows:<idx>interval
      computation/comparison function for</idx></p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="10"/>

      <p>The behavior of <code>Rev_int_interval</code> is of course
      different from <code>Int_interval</code>:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="11"/>

      <p>Importantly, <code>Rev_int_interval.t</code> is a
      different type than <code>Int_interval.t</code>, even though
      its physical representation is the same. Indeed, the type
      system will prevent us from confusing them.</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="12"/>

      <p>This is important, because confusing the two kinds of
      intervals would be a semantic error, and it's an easy one to
      make. The ability of functors to mint new types is a useful
      trick that comes up a lot.</p>

      <section id="making-the-functor-abstract" data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Making the Functor Abstract</h2>

        <p>There's a problem with <code>Make_interval</code>. The
        code we wrote depends on the invariant that the upper bound
        of an interval is greater than its lower bound, but that
        invariant can be violated. The invariant is enforced by the
        <code>create</code> function, but because
        <code>Interval.t</code> is not abstract, we can bypass the
        <code>create</code> function:<idx>interval
        computation/abstract functor for</idx></p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="13"/>

        <p>To make <code>Int_interval.t</code> abstract, we need to
        restrict the output of <code>Make_interval</code> with an
        interface. Here's an explicit interface that we can use for
        that purpose:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="14"/>

        <p>This interface includes the type <code>endpoint</code>
        to give us a way of referring to the endpoint type. Given
        this interface, we can redo our definition of
        <code>Make_interval</code>. Notice that we added the type
        <code>endpoint</code> to the implementation of the module
        to match <code>Interval_intf</code>:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt"
              part="15" />
      </section>

      <section id="sharing-constraints" data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Sharing Constraints</h2>

        <p>
	  The resulting module is abstract, but it's unfortunately
          too abstract. In particular, we haven't exposed the type
          <code>endpoint</code>, which means that we can't even
          construct an interval anymore:

	  <idx>sharing constraint</idx>
	</p>

        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="16"/>

        <p>
	  To fix this, we need to expose the fact that
          <code>endpoint</code> is equal to <code>Int.t</code> (or
          more generally, <code>Endpoint.t</code>, where
          <code>Endpoint</code> is the argument to the functor). One
          way of doing this is through a <em>sharing constraint</em>,
          which allows you to tell the compiler to expose the fact
          that a given type is equal to some other type. The syntax
          for a simple sharing constraint is as follows:</p>

        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/sharing_constraint.syntax"/>

        <p>The result of this expression is a new signature that's
        been modified so that it exposes the fact that
        <em><code>type</code></em> defined inside of the module
        type is equal to <em><code>type'</code></em> whose
        definition is outside of it. One can also apply multiple
        sharing constraints to the same signature:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/multi_sharing_constraint.syntax"/>

        <p>We can use a sharing constraint to create a specialized
        version of <code>Interval_intf</code> for integer
        intervals:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="17"/>

        <p>We can also use sharing constraints in the context of a
        functor. The most common use case is where you want to
        expose that some of the types of the module being generated
        by the functor are related to the types in the module fed
        to the functor.</p>

        <p>In this case, we'd like to expose an equality between
        the type <code>endpoint</code> in the new module and the
        type <code>Endpoint.t</code>, from the module
        <code>Endpoint</code> that is the functor argument. We can
        do this as follows:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="18"/>

        <p>So now, the interface is as it was, except that
        <code>endpoint</code> is known to be equal to
        <code>Endpoint.t</code>. As a result of that type equality,
        we can again do things that require that
        <code>endpoint</code> be exposed, like constructing
        intervals:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="19"/>
      </section>

      <section id="destructive-substitution" data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Destructive Substitution</h2>

        <p>Sharing constraints basically do the job, but they have
        some downsides. In particular, we've now been stuck with
        the useless type declaration of <code>endpoint</code> that
        clutters up both the interface and the implementation. A
        better solution would be to modify the
        <code>Interval_intf</code> signature by replacing
        <code>endpoint</code> with <code>Endpoint.t</code>
        everywhere it shows up, and deleting the definition of
        <code>endpoint</code> from the signature. We can do just
        this using what's called <em>destructive substitution</em>.
        Here's the basic syntax:<idx>destructive
        substitution</idx><idx>interval computation/destructive
        substitution</idx></p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/destructive_sub.syntax"/>

        <p>The following shows how we could use this with
        <code>Make_interval</code>:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="20"/>

        <p>There's now no <code>endpoint</code> type: all of its
        occurrences of have been replaced by <code>int</code>. As
        with sharing constraints, we can also use this in the
        context of a functor:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="21"/>

        <p>The interface is precisely what we want: the type
        <code>t</code> is abstract, and the type of the endpoint is
        exposed; so we can create values of type
        <code>Int_interval.t</code> using the creation function,
        but not directly using the constructors and thereby
        violating the invariants of the module:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="22"/>

        <p>In addition, the <code>endpoint</code> type is gone from
        the interface, meaning we no longer need to define the
        <code>endpoint</code> type alias in the body of the
        module.</p>

        <p>It's worth noting that the name is somewhat misleading,
        in that there's nothing destructive about destructive
        substitution; it's really just a way of creating a new
        signature by transforming an existing one.</p>

      <section id="using-multiple-interfaces" data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Using Multiple Interfaces</h2>

        <p>
	  Another feature that we might want for our interval module
          is the ability to <em>serialize</em>, i.e., to be able to read
          and write intervals as a stream of bytes. In this case, we'll
          do this by converting to and from s-expressions, which were
          mentioned already in 
	  <a href="07-error-handling.html#error-handling" data-type="xref">Error Handling</a>. To recall, an
	  s-expression is essentially a parenthesized expression whose
          atoms are strings, and it is a serialization format that is
          used commonly in Core_kernel. Here's an example:

	  <idx>s-expressions/example of</idx>
	  <idx>interval computation/multiple interfaces and</idx></p>

        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="23"/>

        <p>
	  Core_kernel comes with a syntax extension
	  called <code>ppx_sexp_conv</code> which will generate
	  s-expression conversion functions for any type annotated
	  with <code>[@@deriving sexp]</code>. Thus, we can write:

	  <idx>sexp declaration</idx></p>

        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="24"/>

        <p>We'll discuss s-expressions and Sexplib in more detail
        in <a href="17-data-serialization.html#data-serialization-with-s-expressions" data-type="xref">Data Serialization With S Expressions</a>,
        but for now, let's see what happens if we attach the
        <code>[@@deriving sexp]</code> declaration to the definition of
        <code>t</code> within the functor:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="25"/>

        <p>The problem is that <code>[@@deriving sexp]</code> adds code for
        defining the s-expression converters, and that code assumes
        that <code>Endpoint</code> has the appropriate
        sexp-conversion functions for <code>Endpoint.t</code>. But
        all we know about <code>Endpoint</code> is that it
        satisfies the <code>Comparable</code> interface, which
        doesn't say anything about s-expressions.</p>

        <p>
	  Happily, Core_kernel comes with a built-in interface for
          just this purpose called <code>Sexpable</code>, which is
          defined as follows:</p>

        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/sexpable.ml"/>

        <p>We can modify <code>Make_interval</code> to use the
        <code>Sexpable</code> interface, for both its input and its
        output. First, let's create an extended version of the
        <code>Interval_intf</code> interface that includes the
        functions from the <code>Sexpable</code> interface. We can
        do this using destructive substitution on the
        <code>Sexpable</code> interface, to avoid having multiple
        distinct type <code>t</code>'s clashing with each
        other:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="26"/>

        <p>Equivalently, we can define a type <code>t</code> within
        our new module, and apply destructive substitutions to all
        of the included interfaces, <code>Interval_intf</code>
        included, as shown in the following example. This is
        somewhat cleaner when combining multiple interfaces, since
        it correctly reflects that all of the signatures are being
        handled equivalently:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="27"/>

        <p>Now we can write the functor itself. We have been
        careful to override the sexp converter here to ensure that
        the data structure's invariants are still maintained when
        reading in from an s-expression:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="28"/>

        <p>And now, we can use that sexp converter in the ordinary
        way:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/functors/main.mlt" part="29"/>

    <section id="extending-modules" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>Extending Modules</h1>

      <p>Another common use of functors is to generate
      type-specific functionality for a given module in a
      standardized way. Let's see how this works in the context of
      a functional queue, which is just a functional version of a
      FIFO (first-in, first-out) queue. Being functional,
      operations on the queue return new queues, rather than
      modifying the queues that were passed
      in.<idx>modules/type-specific functionality in</idx><idx>FIFO
      (first-in, first-out) queue</idx><idx>functors/module
      extension with</idx></p>

      <p>Here's a reasonable <code>mli</code> for such a
      module:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/fqueue.mli"/>

      <p>The preceding <code>Fqueue.fold</code> function requires
      some explanation. It follows the same pattern as the
      <code>List.fold</code> function we described in <a href="03-lists-and-patterns.html#using-the-list-module-effectively" data-type="xref">Using The List Module Effectively</a>.
      Essentially, <code>Fqueue.fold q ~init ~f</code> walks over
      the elements of <code>q</code> from front to back, starting
      with an accumulator of <code>init</code> and using
      <code>f</code> to update the accumulator value as it walks
      over the queue, returning the final value of the accumulator
      at the end of the computation. <code>fold</code> is a quite
      powerful operation, as we'll see.</p>

      <p>We'll implement <code>Fqueue</code> the well known trick
      of maintaining an input and an output list so that one can
      efficiently enqueue on the input list and efficiently dequeue
      from the output list. If you attempt to dequeue when the
      output list is empty, the input list is reversed and becomes
      the new output list. Here's the implementation:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/fqueue.ml"/>

      <p>One problem with <code>Fqueue</code> is that the interface
      is quite skeletal. There are lots of useful helper functions
      that one might want that aren't there. The <code>List</code>
      module, by way of contrast, has functions like
      <code>List.iter</code>, which runs a function on each
      element; and <code>List.for_all</code>, which returns true if
      and only if the given predicate evaluates to
      <code>true</code> on every element of the list. Such helper
      functions come up for pretty much every container type, and
      implementing them over and over is a dull and repetitive
      affair.</p>

      <p>As it happens, many of these helper functions can be
      derived mechanically from the <code>fold</code> function we
      already implemented. Rather than write all of these helper
      functions by hand for every new container type, we can
      instead use a functor to add this functionality to any
      container that has a <code>fold</code> function.</p>

      <p>We'll create a new module, <code>Foldable</code>, that
      automates the process of adding helper functions to a
      <code>fold</code>-supporting container. As you can see,
      <code>Foldable</code> contains a module signature
      <code>S</code> which defines the signature that is required
      to support folding; and a functor <code>Extend</code> that
      allows one to extend any module that matches
      <code>Foldable.S</code>:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/foldable.ml"/>

      <p>Now we can apply this to <code>Fqueue</code>. We can
      create an interface for an extended version of
      <code>Fqueue</code> as follows:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/extended_fqueue.mli"/>

      <p>In order to apply the functor, we'll put the definition of
      <code>Fqueue</code> in a submodule called <code>T</code>, and
      then call <code>Foldable.Extend</code> on <code>T</code>:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/functors/extended_fqueue.ml"/>

      <p>
	Core_kernel comes with a number of functors for extending modules
	that follow this same basic pattern,
	including:

	<idx>Monad.Make</idx>
	<idx>Hashable.Make</idx>
	<idx>Comparable module/Comparable.Make</idx>
	<idx>Container.Make</idx></p>

      <dl>
        <dt><code>Container.Make</code></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Very similar to <code>Foldable.Extend</code>.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>Comparable.Make</code></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Adds support for functionality that depends on the
          presence of a comparison function, including support for
          containers like maps and sets.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>Hashable.Make</code></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Adds support for hashing-based data structures
          including hash tables, hash sets, and hash heaps.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>Monad.Make</code></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>For so-called monadic libraries, like those discussed
          in Chapters <a href="07-error-handling.html#error-handling" data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select: labelnumber">Error Handling</a>
          and <a href="18-concurrent-programming.html#concurrent-programming-with-async" data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select: labelnumber">Concurrent Programming With
          Async</a>. Here, the functor is used to provide a
          collection of standard helper functions based on the
          <code>bind</code> and <code>return</code> operators.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
	These functors come in handy when you want to add the same
	kind of functionality that is commonly available in
	Core_kernel to your own types.</p>

      <p>
	We've really only covered some of the possible uses of
	functors. Functors are really a quite powerful tool for
	modularizing your code. The cost is that functors are
	syntactically heavyweight compared to the rest of the
	language, and that there are some tricky issues you need to
	understand to use them effectively, with sharing constraints
	and destructive substitution being high on that list.</p>

      <p>
	All of this means that for small and simple programs, heavy
	use of functors is probably a mistake. But as your programs
	get more complicated and you need more effective modular
	architectures, functors become a highly valuable tool.</p>
