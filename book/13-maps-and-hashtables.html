      <h1>Maps and Hash Tables</h1>

      <p>
	Lots of programming problems require dealing with data
	organized as key/value pairs. Maybe the simplest way of
	representing such data in OCaml is an <em>association
	  list</em>, which is simply a list of pairs of keys and values.
	For example, you could represent a mapping between the 10
	digits and their English names as follows:

	<idx>key/value pairs</idx>
	<idx>data structures/key/value pairs</idx>
	<idx>lists/association lists</idx>
	<idx>association lists</idx></p>

      <link rel="import" part="1"
	    href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

      <p>
	We can use functions from the <code>List.Assoc</code> module
	to manipulate this data:</p>

      <link rel="import" part="2"
	    href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

      <p>
	Association lists are simple and easy to use, but their
	performance is not ideal, since almost every nontrivial
	operation on an association list requires a linear-time scan of
	the list.</p>

      <p>
	In this chapter, we'll talk about two more efficient
	alternatives to association lists: <em>maps</em> and <em>hash
	  tables</em>. A map is an immutable tree-based data structure
	where most operations take time logarithmic in the size of the
	map, whereas a hash table is a mutable data structure where
	most operations have constant time complexity. We'll describe
	both of these data structures in detail and provide some advice
	as to how to choose between them.
	<idx>hash tables/basics of</idx>
	<idx>maps/basics of</idx></p>

      <section id="maps" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Maps</h1>

	<p>
	  We can redo the example we did above using maps instead of
	  association lists.</p>

	<link rel="import" part="3" 
	      href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

	<p>
	  This is a little more concise than the association list
	  version because association list operations need to be told
	  how to check keys for equality on each invocation. Maps need
	  the same information (and more, since they need to be able
	  to order keys, not just check for equality), but this
	  information need only be presented for functions
	  like <code>Map.of_alist_exn</code> that construct a map from
	  scratch.
	</p>

	<p>
	  When building a map, the knowledge of how to compare keys is
	  provided in the form of a first-class module. So, to create
	  an empty map indexed by integers, we'd write <code>Map.empty
	  (module Int)</code>. The comparison function embedded in
	  that module is stored in the constructed map, which is why
	  you don't need to provide it again when using a function
	  like <code>Map.find</code>.
	</p>

	<section id="Comparator witnesses" data-type="sect2">
	  <h2>Comparator witnesses</h2>

	  <p>
	    It's worth taking a moment to look at the type signature of
	    a map, and compare it to that of a corresponding association
	    list.
	  </p>

	  <link rel="import" part="cw.1" 
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

	  <p>
	    The association list effectively has two type parameters,
	    one for the type of the key (<code>int</code>) and one for
	    the type of the data (<code>string</code>).
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The map, on the other hand, has <em>three</em> type
	    parameters: one for the key, one for the data, and one,
	    called the <em>comparator witness</em>. The point of a
	    comparator witness is to identify the comparison function
	    that's being used.  This is to avoid mixing up 
	    maps that have the same key type, but have different ways
	    of ordering those keys
	  </p>

	  
	  <link rel="import" part="cw.1" 
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

	  <p>
	    Most of the time, it does, and
	    indeed, <code>Int.comparator_witness</code> represents the
	    default comparison function provided by
	    the <code>Int</code> module. But as we'll see later, it
	    can be useful to have different comparison functions, and
	    therefore different comparator witnesses, for the same
	    type.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    But before we get to that, we have a more basic question to
	    address. The examples thus far have all used standard types
	    with their own dedicated module in <code>Base</code>; but
	    what if you have your own type that you want to use as a map
	    key? We'll cover that next.
	  </p>
	</section>

	<section id="Maps with custom keys" data-type="sect2">
	  <h2> Maps with custom keys </h2>

	  <p>
	    Imagine you want to create a map indexed by a <em>service
	    identifier</em>, a structured type that identifies
	    instances of services running on your network. Such an
	    identifier might look like this.
	  </p>

          <link rel="import" part="ck.1"
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

	  <p>
	    Note that we used a <code>deriving</code> annotation to
	    request the construction of a comparison function and of
	    an s-expression converter for this type. We could have
	    written these by hand, but in this case,
	    the <code>deriving</code>-based ones will work fine.
	  </p>    

	  <p>
	    This isn't quite enough to generate a map. Indeed, if you
	    try to use the module <code>Service_id</code> we created
	    above to construct a map, you'll get an error.
	  </p>
	  
          <link rel="import" part="ck.2"
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

	  <p>
	    The module we created has a comparison function, but
	    that's not enough.  It also needs a <em>comparator</em>,
	    which is a special value that has a distinguished type
	    (the <code>comparator_witness</code> that showed up
	    earlier) to uniquely identify the comparison function in
	    question. We can build the comparator using a functor that
	    has been designed for that purpose.
	  </p>

          <link rel="import" part="ck.3"
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

	  <p>
	    We can now construct a map using this module, as we did
	    above with the <code>Int</code> module.
	  </p>

          <link rel="import" part="ck.4"
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

	  <p>
	    Now we have two modules, <code>Service_id</code>, which
	    has the definition of a service ID ,
	    and <code>Service_id_comparator</code>, which gives you
	    what you need to construct a map. The following example
	    shows you an idiom that lets you construct a single module
	    that is suitable for both purposes.
	  </p>

          <link rel="import" part="ck.5"
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

	  <p>
	    Here, we created a sub-module <code>T</code> that had the
	    type definition and the sexp converter and comparison
	    function, and then included both <code>T</code>, and the
	    result of applying <code>Comparator.Make</code>
	    to <code>T</code>, in the same module.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The functor <code>Comparator.Make</code> gives you just
	    what you need to create a map. Often, what you really want
	    is the more full-featured <code>Comparable.Make</code>,
	    which additionally creates a bunch of useful utilities for
	    working with values that support comparison.

	<section id="Different comparators for the same type" data-type="sect2">
	  <h2> Different comparators for the same type </h2>

          <p>
	    We still haven't really explained why maps have a
	    comparator witness, that third type parameter that
	    identifies the comparison function in use.  We'll do that
	    now.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    To see how the comparator witness comes into play,
	    consider the type of <code>Map.merge</code>, which is a
	    function for combining two maps into one.
	  </p>

          <link rel="import" part="dc.1"
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

	  <p>
	    If you read the signature carefully, you'll see that the
	    type of the data can be different in all three maps, as
	    indicated by the different type
	    variables, <code>'v1</code>, <code>'v2</code>,
	    and <code>'v3</code> for the two input maps and the
	    resulting map respectively.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The type of the key, <code>'k</code>, and the type of the
	    comparator, <code>'cmp</code>, however, have to be the
	    same throughout.  This means that both the type of the key
	    and the comparison function used on keys must match up.
	    This matters because the algorithm used
	    by <code>Map.merge</code> depends for its efficiency and
	    correctness on the fact that the keys of its two arguments
	    are sorted in the same way.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Let's see what happens if we try to
	    use <code>Map.merge</code> on two maps with the same key
	    that are sorted differently. First, we need to build a
	    comparator for something other than the default comparison
	    function for some type. We do that below.
	  </p>

          <link rel="import" part="dc.2"
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />
	  
	  <p>
	    As the following example demonstrates, the ordering
	    induced by maps constructed with <code>String</code>
	    and <code>Rev_string</code> are in fact different.
	  </p>

          <link rel="import" part="dc.3"
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />

	  <p>
	    Now, let's see what happens if we try to merge together
	    two maps, one built with the <code>String</code>
	    comparator, and one with the <code>Rev_string</code>
	    comparator.
	  </p>

          <link rel="import" part="dc.4"
		href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" />
	  
	  <p>
	    As you can see, OCaml warns us that the two comparators
	    are incompatible.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The example here is a little artificial, but this is a
	    real world issue. For one thing, there are occasional but
	    important situations where you need multiple comparison
	    functions for the same object. For example, you might want
	    different comparison functions to indicate different
	    priority orderings of the same underlying object. In these
	    cases, it's good to have the type system to help you avoid
	    doing crazy things.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Another common case you might run into is when dealing
	    with the comparison that comes from the default per-type
	    comparison function, of the kind that you get
	    from <code>[@@deriving compare]</code>, and the comparison
	    function induced by OCaml's general-purpose (but
	    problematic!) polymorphic comparison function. We'll talk
	    about polymorphic compare later in the chapter, but the
	    observation here is that the comparator helps you avoid
	    mixing polymorphic comparison with other type-specific
	    comparison functions.

	<section id="the-polymorphic-comparator" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>The Polymorphic Comparator</h2>

          <p>
	    We don't need to generate specialized comparators for
            every type we want to build a map on. We can instead use a
            comparator based on OCaml's built-in polymorphic comparison
            function, which was discussed in <a href="03-lists-and-patterns.html#lists-and-patterns" data-type="xref">Lists And Patterns</a>. This comparator is found in
            the <code>Comparator.Poly</code> module, allowing us to
            write:

	    <idx>maps/polymorphic comparison in</idx>
	    <idx>Comparator.Poly module</idx>
	    <idx>polymorphic comparisons</idx></p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="14"/>

          <p>
	    Or, equivalently:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="15"/>

          <p>
	    Note that maps based on the polymorphic comparator are
            not equivalent to those based on the type-specific
            comparators from the point of view of the type system.
            Thus, the compiler rejects the following:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="16"/>

          <p>
	    This is rejected for good reason: there's no guarantee
            that the comparator associated with a given type will order
            things in the same way that polymorphic compare does.</p>

          <aside data-type="sidebar">
            <h5>The Perils of Polymorphic Compare</h5>

            <p>
	      Polymorphic compare is highly convenient, but it has
              serious downsides as well and should be used with care.
              In particular, polymorphic compare has a fixed algorithm
              for comparing values of any type, and that algorithm can
              sometimes yield surprising results.</p>

            <p>
	      To understand what's wrong with polymorphic compare,
              you need to understand a bit about how it works.
              Polymorphic compare is <em>structural</em>, in that it
              operates directly on the runtime representation of OCaml
              values, walking the structure of the values in question
              without regard for their type.</p>

            <p>
	      This is convenient because it provides a comparison
              function that works for most OCaml values and largely
              behaves as you would expect. For example,
              on <code>int</code>s and <code>float</code>s, it acts as
              you would expect a numeric comparison function to
              act. For simple containers like strings and lists and
              arrays, it operates as a lexicographic comparison. And
              except for values from outside of the OCaml heap and
              functions, it works on almost every OCaml type.</p>

            <p>
	      But sometimes, a structural comparison is not what you
              want. Sets are a great example of this. Consider the
              following two sets:</p>

            <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="18"/>

            <p>
	      Logically, these two sets should be equal, and that's
              the result that you get if you call
              <code>Set.equal</code> on them:</p>

            <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="19"/>

            <p>
	      But because the elements were added in different
              orders, the layout of the trees underlying the sets will
              be different. As such, a structural comparison function
              will conclude that they're different.</p>

            <p>
	      Let's see what happens if we use polymorphic compare
              to test for equality by way of the <code>=</code>
              operator. Comparing the maps directly will fail at
              runtime because the comparators stored within the sets
              contain function values:</p>

            <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="20"/>

            <p>
	      We can, however, use the function
              <code>Set.to_tree</code> to expose the underlying tree
              without the attached comparator:</p>

            <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="21"/>

            <p>
	      This can cause real and quite subtle bugs. If, for
              example, you use a map whose keys contain sets, then the
              map built with the polymorphic comparator will behave
              incorrectly, separating out keys that should be
              aggregated together. Even worse, it will work sometimes
              and fail others; since if the sets are built in a
              consistent order, then they will work as expected, but
              once the order changes, the behavior will change.</p>

	<section id="sets" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>Sets</h2>

          <p>
	    Sometimes, instead of keeping track of a set of key/value
            pairs, you just want to keep track of a set of keys. You
            could representing a set of values by a map whose data
            type is <code>unit</code>. But a more idiomatic (and
            efficient) solution is to use Core's set type, which is
            similar in design and spirit to the map type, while having
            an API better tuned to working with sets and a lower
            memory footprint. Here's a simple example:
	    <idx>set types</idx></p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="17"/>

          <p>
	    In addition to the operators you would expect to have
            for maps, sets support the traditional set operations,
            including union, intersection, and set difference. And, as
            with maps, we can create sets based on type-specific
            comparators or on the polymorphic comparator.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="satisfying-the-comparable.s-interface" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>Satisfying the Comparable.S Interface</h2>

          <p>
	    Core's <code>Comparable.S</code> interface includes a
            lot of useful functionality, including support for working
            with maps and sets. In particular,
            <code>Comparable.S</code> requires the presence of the
            <code>Map</code> and <code>Set</code> submodules, as well
            as a comparator.

	    <idx>interfaces/Comparable.S</idx>
	    <idx>Comparable module/Comparable.Make</idx>
	    <idx>Comparable module/Comparable.S</idx>
	    <idx>maps/comparable.S interface</idx></p>

          <p>
	    <code>Comparable.S</code> is satisfied by most of the
            types in Core, but the question arises of how to satisfy
            the comparable interface for a new type that you design.
            Certainly implementing all of the required functionality
            from scratch would be an absurd amount of work.</p>

          <p>
	    The module <code>Comparable</code> contains a number of
            functors to help you automate this task. The simplest one
            of these is <code>Comparable.Make</code>, which takes as an
            input any module that satisfies the following
            interface:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/comparable.ml"/>

          <p>
	    In other words, it expects a type with a comparison
            function, as well as functions for converting to and
            from <em>s-expressions</em>. S-expressions are a
            serialization format used commonly in Core and are
            required here to enable better error messages. We'll
            discuss s-expressions more
            in <a href="17-data-serialization.html#data-serialization-with-s-expressions"
            data-type="xref">Data Serialization With S
            Expressions</a>, but in the meantime, we'll use
            the <code>[@@deriving sexp]</code> annotation that comes
            from the <code>ppx_sexp_conv</code> syntax extension.
            This declaration kicks off the automatic generation of
            s-expression conversion functions for the marked type.</p>

          <p>
	    The following example shows how this all fits together,
            following the same basic pattern for using functors described
            in <a href="09-functors.html#extending-modules" data-type="xref">Extending Modules</a>:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="22"/>

          <p>
	    We don't include the full response from the toplevel
            because it is quite lengthy, but <code>Foo_and_bar</code>
            does satisfy <code>Comparable.S</code>.</p>

          <p>
	    In the preceding code we wrote the comparison function by
            hand, but this isn't strictly necessary. Core ships with a
            syntax extension which will create a comparison function
            from a type definition if you write <code>[@@deriving
            compare]</code> after the type defintion.  We can rewrite
            the previous example to use this extension</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="23"/>

          <p>
	    The comparison function we get from <code>[@@deriving
	    compare]</code> will call out to the comparison functions
	    for its component types. As a result, the <code>foo</code>
	    field will be compared
	    using <code>Int.Set.compare</code>. This is different, and
            saner than the structural comparison done by polymorphic
            compare.</p>

          <p>
	    If you want your comparison function that orders things in
	    a particular way, you can always write your own comparison
            function by hand; but if all you need is a total order
            suitable for creating maps and sets with,
            then <code>[@@deriving compare]</code> is a good
            choice.</p>

          <p>
	    You can also satisfy the <code>Comparable.S</code>
            interface using polymorphic compare:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="24"/>

          <p>
	    That said, for reasons we discussed earlier, polymorphic
            compare should be used sparingly.</p>

          <aside data-type="sidebar">
            <h5>=, ==, and phys_equal</h5>

            <p>
	      If you come from a C/C++ background, you'll probably
              reflexively use <code>==</code> to test two values for
              equality. In OCaml, the <code>==</code> operator tests
              for <em>physical</em> equality, while the <code>=</code>
              operator tests for <em>structural</em> equality.</p>

            <p>
	      The physical equality test will match if two data
              structures have precisely the same pointer in memory. Two
              data structures that have identical contents but are
              constructed separately will not match using
              <code>==</code>.</p>

            <p>
	      The <code>=</code> structural equality operator
              recursively inspects each field in the two values and
              tests them individually for equality. Crucially, if your
              data structure is cyclical (that is, a value recursively
              points back to another field within the same structure),
              the <code>=</code> operator will never terminate, and
              your program will hang! You therefore must use the
              physical equality operator or write a custom comparison
              function when comparing cyclic values.</p>

            <p>
	      It's quite easy to mix up the use of <code>=</code>
              and <code>==</code>, so Core_kernel discourages the use
              of <code>==</code> and provides the more
              explicit <code>phys_equal</code> function
              instead. You'll see a warning if you use <code>==</code>
              anywhere in code that
              opens <code>Core_kernel</code>:</p>

	<h1>Hash Tables</h1>

	<p>
	  Hash tables are the imperative cousin of maps. We walked
	  over a basic hash table implementation in <a href="08-imperative-programming.html#imperative-programming-1" data-type="xref">Imperative Programming 1</a>, so in this
	  section we'll mostly discuss the pragmatics of Core's
	  <code>Hashtbl</code> module. We'll cover this material more
	  briefly than we did with maps because many of the concepts
	  are shared.

	  <idx>hash tables/basics of</idx></p>

	<p>
	  Hash tables differ from maps in a few key ways. First,
	  hash tables are mutable, meaning that adding a key/value pair
	  to a hash table modifies the table, rather than creating a
	  new table with the binding added. Second, hash tables
	  generally have better time-complexity than maps, providing
	  constant-time lookup and modifications, as opposed to
	  logarithmic for maps. And finally, just as maps depend on
	  having a comparison function for creating the ordered binary
	  tree that underlies a map, hash tables depend on having a
	  <em>hash function</em>, i.e., a function for converting a key
	  to an integer.

	  <idx>functions/hash functions</idx>
	  <idx>Hashtbl module</idx>
	  <idx>hash tables/time complexity of</idx></p>

	<div class="allow_break" data-type="warning">
          <h1>Time Complexity of Hash Tables</h1>

          <p>
	    The statement that hash tables provide constant-time
            access hides some complexities. First of all, any hash
            table implementation, OCaml's included, needs to resize the
            table when it gets too full. A resize requires allocating a
            new backing array for the hash table and copying over all
            entries, and so it is quite an expensive operation. That
            means adding a new element to the table is only
            <em>amortized</em> constant, which is to say, it's constant
            on average over a long sequence of operations, but some of
            the individual operations can be quite expensive.</p>

          <p>
	    Another hidden cost of hash tables has to do with the
            hash function you use. If you end up with a pathologically
            bad hash function that hashes all of your data to the same
            number, then all of your insertions will hash to the same
            underlying bucket, meaning you no longer get constant-time
            access at all. Core's hash table implementation uses binary
            trees for the hash-buckets, so this case only leads to
            logarithmic time, rather than linear for a traditional hash
            table.</p>

          <p>
	    The logarithmic behavior of Core's hash tables in the
            presence of hash collisions also helps protect against some
            denial-of-service attacks. One well-known type of attack is
            to send queries to a service with carefully chosen keys to
            cause many collisions. This, in combination with the linear
            behavior of most hashtables, can cause the service to
            become unresponsive due to high CPU load. Core's hash
            tables would be much less susceptible to such an attack
            because the amount of degradation would be far less.

	</div>

	<p>
	  When creating a hash table, we need to provide a value of
	  type <em>hashable</em>, which includes among other things the
	  function for hashing the key type. This is analogous to the
	  comparator used for creating maps:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="25"/>

	<p>
	  The <code>hashable</code> value is included as part of the
	  <code>Hashable.S</code> interface, which is satisfied by most
	  types in Core. The <code>Hashable.S</code> interface also
	  includes a <code>Table</code> submodule which provides more
	  convenient creation functions:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="26"/>

	<p>
	  There is also a polymorphic <code>hashable</code> value,
	  corresponding to the polymorphic hash function provided by
	  the OCaml runtime, for cases where you don't have a hash
	  function for your specific type:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="27"/>

	<p>
	  Or, equivalently:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="28"/>

	<p>
	  Note that, unlike the comparators used with maps and sets,
	  hashables don't show up in the type of a
	  <code>Hashtbl.t</code>. That's because hash tables don't have
	  operations that operate on multiple hash tables that depend
	  on those tables having the same hash function, in the way
	  that <code>Map.symmetric_diff</code> and
	  <code>Set.union</code> depend on their arguments using the
	  same comparison function.

	  <idx>polymorphism/in hash functions</idx></p>

	<div data-type="warning">
          <h1>Collisions with the Polymorphic Hash Function</h1>

          <p>
	    OCaml's polymorphic hash function works by walking over
            the data structure it’s given using a breadth-first
            traversal that is bounded in the number of nodes it’s
            willing to traverse. By default, that bound is set at 10
            "meaningful" nodes.

	    <idx>hash tables/polymorphic hash function</idx></p>

          <p>
	    The bound on the traversal means that the hash function
            may ignore part of the data structure, and this can lead to
            pathological <span class="keep-together">cases</span> where
            every value you store has the same hash value. We'll
            demonstrate this below, using the function
            <code>List.range</code> to allocate lists of integers of
            different length:</p>
	</div>

	<link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="29"/>

	<p>
	  As you can see, the hash function stops after the first 10
	  elements. The same can happen with any large data structure,
	  including records and arrays. When building hash functions
	  over large custom data structures, it is generally a good
	  idea to write one's own hash function.</p>

	<section id="satisfying-the-hashable.s-interface" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>Satisfying the Hashable.S Interface</h2>

          <p>
	    Most types in Core satisfy the <code>Hashable.S</code>
            interface, but as with the <code>Comparable.S</code>
            interface, the question remains of how one should satisfy
            this interface when writing a new module. Again, the
            answer is to use a functor to build the necessary
            functionality; in this case, <code>Hashable.Make</code>,
            using <code>[@@deriving hash]</code> to produce the hash
            function.

          <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/main.topscript" part="30"/>

          <p>
	    Note that in order to satisfy hashable, a key needs to
            provide a comparison function, for equality checking, and
            s-expression conversion, for generating useful errors.</p>

          <p>
	    There is currently no analogue of
            <code>comparelib</code> for autogeneration of hash
            functions, so you do need to either write the hash function
            by hand, or use the built-in polymorphic hash function,
            <code>Hashtbl.hash</code>.</p>

      <section id="choosing-between-maps-and-hash-tables" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Choosing Between Maps and Hash Tables</h1>

	<p>
	  Maps and hash tables overlap enough in functionality that
	  it's not always clear when to choose one or the other. Maps,
	  by virtue of being immutable, are generally the default
	  choice in OCaml. OCaml also has good support for imperative
	  programming, though, and when programming in an imperative
	  idiom, hash tables are often the more natural choice.

	  <idx>maps/vs. hashtables</idx>
	  <idx>hash tables/vs. maps</idx></p>

	<p>
	  Programming idioms aside, there are significant
	  performance differences between maps and hash tables. For
	  code that is dominated by updates and lookups, hash tables
	  are a clear performance win, and the win is clearer the
	  larger the amount of data.</p>

	<p>
	  The best way of answering a performance question is by
	  running a benchmark, so let's do just that. The following
	  benchmark uses the <code>core_bench</code> library, and it
	  compares maps and hash tables under a very simple workload.
	  Here, we're keeping track of a set of 1,000 different integer
	  keys and cycling over the keys and updating the values they
	  contain. Note that we use the <code>Map.change</code> and
	  <code>Hashtbl.change</code> functions to update the
	  respective data structures:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/map_vs_hash/map_vs_hash.ml"/>

	<p>
	  The results show the hash table version to be around four
	  times faster than the map version:</p>
  <link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/map_vs_hash/jbuild"/>
	<link rel="import" href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/map_vs_hash/run_map_vs_hash.sh"/>

	<p>
	  We can make the speedup smaller or larger depending on the
	  details of the test; for example, it will vary with the
	  number of distinct keys. But overall, for code that is heavy
	  on sequences of querying and updating a set of key/value
	  pairs, hash tables will significantly outperform maps.</p>

	<p>
	  Hash tables are not always the faster choice, though. In
	  particular, maps excel in situations where you need to keep
	  multiple related versions of the data structure in memory at
	  once. That's because maps are immutable, and so operations
	  like <code>Map.add</code> that modify a map do so by
	  creating a new map, leaving the original
	  undisturbed. Moreover, the new and old maps share most of
	  their physical structure, so multiple versions can be kept
	  around efficiently.</p>

	<p>
	  Here's a benchmark that demonstrates this. In it, we
	  create a list of maps (or hash tables) that are built up by
	  iteratively applying small updates, keeping these copies
	  around. In the map case, this is done by using
	  <code>Map.change</code> to update the map. In the hash table
	  implementation, the updates are done using
	  <code>Hashtbl.change</code>, but we also need to call
	  <code>Hashtbl.copy</code> to take snapshots of the table:</p>

	<link rel="import" 
	      href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/map_vs_hash2/map_vs_hash2.ml"/>

	<p>
	  Unsurprisingly, maps perform far better than hash tables
	  on this benchmark, in this case by more than a factor of
	  10:</p>
	<link rel="import" 
	      href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/map_vs_hash2/jbuild"/>
	<link rel="import" 
	      href="code/maps-and-hash-tables/map_vs_hash2/run_map_vs_hash2.sh"/>

	<p>
	  These numbers can be made more extreme by increasing the
	  size of the tables or the length of the list.</p>

	<p>
	  As you can see, the relative performance of trees and maps
	  depends a great deal on the details of how they're used, and so
	  whether to choose one data structure or the other will depend on
	  the details of the application.
