    <h1>Records</h1>

    <p>One of OCaml's best features is its concise and expressive
    system for declaring new data types. <em>Records</em> are a key
    element of that system. We discussed records briefly in
    <a href="01-guided-tour.html#a-guided-tour" data-type="xref">A
    Guided Tour</a>, but this chapter will go into more depth,
    covering more of the technical details, as well as providing
    advice on how to use records effectively in your software
    designs.</p>

    <p>A record represents a collection of values stored together
    as one, where each component is identified by a different field
    name. The basic syntax for a record type declaration is as
    follows:

      <idx>records/basic syntax for</idx>
    </p>

    <link rel="import" href="code/records/record.syntax"/>

    <p>Note that record field names must start with a lowercase
    letter.</p>

    <p>
      Here's a simple example: a <code>service_info</code> record that
      represents an entry from the <code>/etc/services</code> file on
      a typical Unix system. That file is used for keeping track of
      the well-known port and protocol name for protocols such as FTP
      or SSH.  Note that we're going to open <code>Core</code> in this
      example rather than <code>Base</code>, since we're using the
      Unix API, which you need <code>Core</code> for.
    </p>

    <link rel="import" part="0.5" href="code/records/main.topscript"/>

    <p>We can construct a <code>service_info</code> just as easily
    as we declared its type. The following function tries to
    construct such a record given as input a line from
    <code>/etc/services</code> file. To do this, we'll use
    <code>Re</code>, a regular expression engine for OCaml. If you
    don't know how regular expressions work, you can just think of
    them as a simple pattern language you can use for parsing a
    string.</p>
    <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="1"/>

    <p>We can construct a concrete record by calling the function
    on a line from the file.</p>
    <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="1.1"/>

    <p>You might wonder how the compiler inferred that our function
    returns a value of type <code>service_info</code>. In this
    case, the compiler bases its inference on the field names used
    in constructing the record. That inference is most
    straightforward when each field name belongs to only one record
    type. We'll discuss later in the chapter what happens when
    field names are shared across different record types.</p>

    <p>Once we have a record value in hand, we can extract elements
    from the record field using dot notation:</p>
    <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="2"/>

    <p>When declaring an OCaml type, you always have the option of
    parameterizing it by a polymorphic type. Records are no
    different in this regard. As an example, here's a type that
    represents an arbitrary item tagged with a line number.</p>
    <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="3"/>

    <p>We can then write polymorphic functions that operate over
    this parameterized type. For example, this function takes a
    file and parses it as a series of lines, using the provided
    function for parsing each individual line.</p>
    <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="4"/>

    <p>We can then use this function for parsing a snippet of a
    real <code>/etc/services</code> file.</p>
    <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="4.1"/>

    <p>The polymorphism lets us use the same function when parsing
    a different format, like this function for parsing a file
    containing an integer on every line.</p>
    <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="4.2"/>

    <section id="patterns-and-exhaustiveness" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>Patterns and Exhaustiveness</h1>

      <p>Another way of getting information out of a record is by
      using a pattern match, as shown in the following
      function.<idx>pattern matching/and
      exhaustiveness</idx><idx>records/patterns and exhaustiveness
      in</idx></p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="5"/>

      <p>Note that the pattern we used had only a single case,
      rather than using several cases separated by
      <code>|</code>'s. We needed only one pattern because record
      patterns are <em>irrefutable</em>, meaning that a record
      pattern match will never fail at runtime. That's because the
      set of fields available in a record is always the same. In
      general, patterns for types with a fixed structure, like
      records and tuples, are irrefutable, unlike types with
      variable structures like lists and variants.<idx>irrefutable
      patterns</idx><idx>datatypes/fixed vs. variable structure
      of</idx></p>

      <p>Another important characteristic of record patterns is
      that they don't need to be complete; a pattern can mention
      only a subset of the fields in the record. This can be
      convenient, but it can also be error prone. In particular,
      this means that when new fields are added to the record, code
      that should be updated to react to the presence of those new
      fields will not be flagged by the compiler.</p>

      <p>As an example, imagine that we wanted to change
      our <code>service_info</code> record so that it preserves
      comments. We can do this by providing a new definition
      of <code>service_info</code> that includes
      a <code>comment</code> field:</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="6"/>

      <p>The code for <code>service_info_to_string</code> would
      continue to compile without change. But in this case, we
      should probably update the code so that the generated string
      includes the comment if it's there. It would be nice if the
      type system would warn us that we should consider updating
      the function.</p>

      <p>Happily, OCaml offers an optional warning for missing
      fields in record patterns. With that warning turned on (which
      you can do in the toplevel by typing <code>#warnings
      "+9"</code>), the compiler will indeed warn
      us.<idx>errors/compiler warnings</idx><idx>code
      compilers/warning enable/disable</idx><idx>errors/missing
      field warnings</idx><idx>records/missing field
      warnings</idx></p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="7"/>

      <p>We can disable the warning for a given pattern by
      explicitly acknowledging that we are ignoring extra fields.
      This is done by adding an underscore to the pattern:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="8"/>

      <p>It's a good idea to enable the warning for incomplete
      record matches and to explicitly disable it with an
      <code>_</code> where necessary.</p>

      <div class="allow_break" data-type="note">
        <h1>Compiler Warnings</h1>

        <p>The OCaml compiler is packed full of useful warnings
        that can be enabled and disabled separately. These are
        documented in the compiler itself, so we could have found
        out about warning 9 as follows:</p>
        <link rel="import" href="code/records/warn_help.sh"/>

        <p>You can think of OCaml's warnings as a powerful set of
        optional static analysis tools. They're enormously helpful
        in catching all sorts of bugs, and and you should enable
        them in your build environment. You don't typically enable
        all warnings, but the defaults that ship with the compiler
        are pretty good.</p>

        <p>The warnings used for building the examples in this book
        are specified with the following flag: <code>-w
        @A-4-33-40-41-42-43-34-44</code>.</p>

        <p>The syntax of <code>-w</code> can be found by running
        <code>ocaml -help</code>, but this particular invocation
        turns on all warnings as errors, disabling only the numbers
        listed explicitly after the <code>A</code>.</p>

        <p>Treating warnings as errors (i.e., making OCaml fail to
        compile any code that triggers a warning) is good practice,
        since without it, warnings are too often ignored during
        development. When preparing a package for distribution,
        however, this is a bad idea, since the list of warnings may
        grow from one release of the compiler to another, and so
        this may lead your package to fail to compile on newer
        compiler releases.</p>

    <section id="field-punning" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>Field Punning</h1>

      <p>When the name of a variable coincides with the name of a
      record field, OCaml provides some handy syntactic shortcuts.
      For example, the pattern in the following function binds all
      of the fields in question to variables of the same name. This
      is called <em>field punning</em>:<idx>fields/field
      punning</idx><idx>records/field punning in</idx></p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="9"/>

      <p>Field punning can also be used to construct a record.
      Consider the following updated version of
      <code>service_info_of_string</code>.<idx>records/construction
      of</idx></p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="10"/>

      <p>In the preceding code, we defined variables corresponding
      to the record fields first, and then the record declaration
      itself simply listed the fields that needed to be included.
      You can take advantage of both field punning and label
      punning when writing a function for constructing a record
      from labeled arguments:<idx>label
      punning</idx><idx>records/label punning in</idx></p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="11"/>

      <p>This is considerably more concise than what you would get
      without punning:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="12"/>

      <p>Together, field and label punning encourage a style where
      you propagate the same names throughout your codebase. This
      is generally good practice, since it encourages consistent
      naming, which makes it easier to navigate the source.</p>

    <section id="reusing-field-names" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>Reusing Field Names</h1>

      <p>Defining records with the same field names can be
      problematic. As a simple example, let's consider a collection
      of types representing the protocol of a logging
      server.<idx id="FNreus">fields/reusing field
      names</idx><idx id="RECreusfn">records/reusing field
      names</idx></p>

      <p>We'll describe three message
      types: <code>log_entry</code>, <code>heartbeat</code>,
      and <code>logon</code>. The <code>log_entry</code> message is
      used to deliver a log entry to the server;
      the <code>logon</code> message is sent when initiating a
      connection and includes the identity of the user connecting and
      credentials used for authentication; and
      the <code>heartbeat</code> message is periodically sent by the
      client to demonstrate to the server that the client is alive and
      connected. All of these messages include a session ID and the
      time the message was generated.</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="13"/>

      <p>Reusing field names can lead to some ambiguity. For
      example, if we want to write a function to grab the
      <code>session_id</code> from a record, what type will it
      have?</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="14"/>

      <p>In this case, OCaml just picks the most recent definition
      of that record field. We can force OCaml to assume we're
      dealing with a different type (say, a <code>heartbeat</code>)
      using a type annotation:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="15"/>

      <p>While it's possible to resolve ambiguous field names using
      type annotations, the ambiguity can be a bit confusing.
      Consider the following functions for grabbing the session ID
      and status from a heartbeat:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main.topscript" part="16"/>

      <p>Why did the first definition succeed without a type
      annotation and the second one fail? The difference is that in
      the first case, the type-checker considered the
      <code>status_message</code> field first and thus concluded
      that the record was a <code>heartbeat</code>. When the order
      was switched, the <code>session_id</code> field was
      considered first, and so that drove the type to be considered
      to be a <code>logon</code>, at which point
      <code>t.status_message</code> no longer made sense.</p>

      <p>We can avoid this ambiguity altogether, either by using
      nonoverlapping field names or by putting different record
      types in different modules. Indeed, packing types into
      modules is a broadly useful idiom (and one used quite
      extensively by <code>Core</code>), providing for each type a
      namespace within which to put related values. When using this
      style, it is standard practice to name the type associated
      with the module <code>t</code>. Using this style we would
      write:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="17"/>

      <p>Now, our log-entry-creation function can be rendered as
      follows:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="18"/>

      <p>The module name <code>Log_entry</code> is required to
      qualify the fields, because this function is outside of the
      <code>Log_entry</code> module where the record was defined.
      OCaml only requires the module qualification for one record
      field, however, so we can write this more concisely. Note
      that we are allowed to insert whitespace between the module
      path and the field name:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="19"/>

      <p>Earlier, we saw that you could help OCaml understand which
      record field was intended by adding a type annotation. Let's see
      what happens if we try that here.</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript"
	    part="19.1"/>

      <p>This triggers warning 40, showing that a type annotation
      causes the selection of an identifier in a different module. If
      we disable warning 40, this definition goes through without
      issue.</p>  
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="19.2"/>

      <p>This is not restricted to constructing a record; we can
      use the same trick when pattern matching:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="20"/>

      <p>When using dot notation for accessing record fields, we
      can qualify the field by the module as well.</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="21"/>

      <p>The syntax here is a little surprising when you first
      encounter it. The thing to keep in mind is that the dot is
      being used in two ways: the first dot is a record field
      access, with everything to the right of the dot being
      interpreted as a field name; the second dot is accessing the
      contents of a module, referring to the record field
      <code>important</code> from within the module
      <code>Log_entry</code>. The fact that <code>Log_entry</code>
      is capitalized and so can't be a field name is what
      disambiguates the two uses.</p>

      <p>Qualifying a record field by the module it comes from can be
      awkward. Happily, OCaml doesn't require that the record field be
      qualified if it can otherwise infer the type of the record in
      question. In particular, we can rewrite the above declarations
      by adding type annotations and removing the module
      qualifications.</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="21.1"/>

      <p>This feature of the language, known by the somewhat imposing
      name of <em>type-directed constructor disambiguation</em>,
      applies to variant constructors as well as record fields, as
      we'll see in <a href="06-variants.html#variants" data-type="xref">Variants</a>.
      </p>

      <p>For functions defined within the module where a given record
      is defined, the module qualification goes away entirely.

    <section id="functional-updates" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>Functional Updates</h1>

      <p>Fairly often, you will find yourself wanting to create a
      new record that differs from an existing record in only a
      subset of the fields. For example, imagine our logging server
      had a record type for representing the state of a given
      client, including when the last heartbeat was received from
      that client. The following defines a type for representing
      this information, as well as a function for updating the
      client information when a new heartbeat
      arrives:<idx>functional updates</idx><idx>records/functional
      updates to</idx></p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="22"/>

      <p>This is fairly verbose, given that there's only one field
      that we actually want to change, and all the others are just
      being copied over from <code>t</code>. We can use OCaml's
      <em>functional update</em> syntax to do this more tersely.
      The syntax of a functional update is as follows:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/functional_update.syntax"/>

      <p>The purpose of the functional update is to create a new
      record based on an existing one, with a set of field changes
      layered on top.</p>

      <p>Given this, we can rewrite <code>register_heartbeat</code>
      more concisely:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="23"/>

      <p>Functional updates make your code independent of the
      identity of the fields in the record that are not changing.
      This is often what you want, but it has downsides as well. In
      particular, if you change the definition of your record to
      have more fields, the type system will not prompt you to
      reconsider whether your code needs to change to accommodate
      the new fields. Consider what happens if we decided to add a
      field for the status message received on the last
      heartbeat:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="24"/>

      <p>The original implementation of
      <code>register_heartbeat</code> would now be invalid, and
      thus the compiler would effectively warn us to think about
      how to handle this new field. But the version using a
      functional update continues to compile as is, even though it
      incorrectly ignores the new field. The correct thing to do
      would be to update the code as follows:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="25"/>
    </section>

    <section id="mutable-fields" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>Mutable Fields</h1>

      <p>Like most OCaml values, records are immutable by default.
      You can, however, declare individual record fields as
      mutable. In the following code, we've made the last two
      fields of <code>client_info</code> mutable:<idx>mutable
      record fields</idx><idx>records/mutable fields in</idx></p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="26"/>

      <p>The <code>&lt;-</code> operator is used for setting a
      mutable field. The side-effecting version of
      <code>register_heartbeat</code> would be written as
      follows:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="27"/>

      <p>Note that mutable assignment, and thus the
      <code>&lt;-</code> operator, is not needed for initialization
      because all fields of a record, including mutable ones, are
      specified when the record is created.</p>

      <p>OCaml's policy of immutable-by-default is a good one, but
      imperative programming is an important part of programming in
      OCaml. We go into more depth about how (and when) to use
      OCaml's imperative features in <a href="01-guided-tour.html#imperative-programming" data-type="xref">Imperative Programming</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="first-class-fields" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>First-Class Fields</h1>

      <p>Consider the following function for extracting the
      usernames from a list of <code>Logon</code> messages:<idx id="Ffc">fields/first-class fields</idx><idx id="firstclass">first-class fields</idx><idx id="RECfirstclass">records/first-class fields in</idx></p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="28"/>

      <p>Here, we wrote a small function <code>(fun x -&gt;
      x.Logon.user)</code> to access the <code>user</code> field.
      This kind of accessor function is a common enough pattern that
      it would be convenient to generate it automatically.
      The <code>ppx_fields_conv</code> syntax extension that ships
      with <code>Core</code> does just that.<idx>record field accessor
      functions</idx></p>

      <p>The <code>[@@deriving fields]</code> annotation at the end of
      the declaration of a record type will cause the extension to be
      applied to a given type declaration. So, for example, we could
      have defined <code>Logon</code> as follows:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript"
      part="29"/>

      <p>Note that this will generate <em>a lot</em> of output
      because <code>fieldslib</code> generates a large collection
      of helper functions for working with record fields. We'll
      only discuss a few of these; you can learn about the
      remainder from the documentation that comes with
      <code>fieldslib</code>.</p>

      <p>One of the functions we obtain is <code>Logon.user</code>,
      which we can use to extract the user field from a logon
      message:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="30"/>

      <p>In addition to generating field accessor functions,
      <code>fieldslib</code> also creates a submodule called
      <code>Fields</code> that contains a first-class
      representative of each field, in the form of a value of type
      <code>Field.t</code>. The <code>Field</code> module provides
      the following functions:<idx>Field
      module/Field.setter</idx><idx>Field
      module/Field.fset</idx><idx>Field
      module/Field.get</idx><idx>Field
      module/Field.name</idx><idx>fieldslib</idx></p>

        <dd>
          <p>Returns the content of a field</p>

        <dt><code>Field.fset</code></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Does a functional update of a field</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>Field.setter</code></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Returns <code>None</code> if the field is not mutable
          or <code>Some f</code> if it is, where <code>f</code> is
          a function for mutating that field</p>

      <p>A <code>Field.t</code> has two type parameters: the first
      for the type of the record, and the second for the type of
      the field in question. Thus, the type of
      <code>Logon.Fields.session_id</code> is <code>(Logon.t,
      string) Field.t</code>, whereas the type of
      <code>Logon.Fields.time</code> is <code>(Logon.t, Time.t)
      Field.t</code>. Thus, if you call <code>Field.get</code> on
      <code>Logon.Fields.user</code>, you'll get a function for
      extracting the <code>user</code> field from a
      <code>Logon.t</code>:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="31"/>

      <p>Thus, the first parameter of the <code>Field.t</code>
      corresponds to the record you pass to <code>get</code>, and
      the second parameter corresponds to the value contained in
      the field, which is also the return type of
      <code>get</code>.</p>

      <p>The type of <code>Field.get</code> is a little more
      complicated than you might naively expect from the preceding
      one:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="32"/>

      <p>The type is <code>Field.t_with_perm</code> rather than
      <code>Field.t</code> because fields have a notion of access
      control that comes up in some special cases where we expose
      the ability to read a field from a record, but not the
      ability to create new records, and so we can't expose
      functional updates.</p>

      <p>We can use first-class fields to do things like write a
      generic function for displaying a record field:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="33"/>

      <p>This takes three arguments: the <code>Field.t</code>, a
      function for converting the contents of the field in question
      to a string, and a record from which the field can be
      grabbed.</p>

      <p>Here's an example of <code>show_field</code> in
      action:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="34"/>

      <p>As a side note, the preceding example is our first use of
      the <code>Fn</code> module (short for "function"), which
      provides a collection of useful primitives for dealing with
      functions. <code>Fn.id</code> is the identity function.</p>

      <p><code>fieldslib</code> also provides higher-level
      operators, like <code>Fields.fold</code> and
      <code>Fields.iter</code>, which let you walk over the fields
      of a record. So, for example, in the case of
      <code>Logon.t</code>, the field iterator has the following
      type:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="35"/>

      <p>This is a bit daunting to look at, largely because of the
      access control markers, but the structure is actually pretty
      simple. Each labeled argument is a function that takes a
      first-class field of the necessary type as an argument. Note
      that <code>iter</code> passes each of these callbacks the
      <code>Field.t</code>, not the contents of the specific record
      field. The contents of the field, though, can be looked up
      using the combination of the record and the
      <code>Field.t</code>.</p>

      <p>Now, let's use <code>Logon.Fields.iter</code> and
      <code>show_field</code> to print out all the fields of a
      <code>Logon</code> record:</p>
      <link rel="import" href="code/records/main2.topscript" part="36"/>

      <p>One nice side effect of this approach is that it helps you
      adapt your code when the fields of a record change. If you
      were to add a field to <code>Logon.t</code>, the type of
      <code>Logon.Fields.iter</code> would change along with it,
      acquiring a new argument. Any code using
      <code>Logon.Fields.iter</code> won't compile until it's fixed
      to take this new argument into account.</p>

      <p>Field iterators are useful for a variety of record-related
      tasks, from building record-validation functions to
      scaffolding the definition of a web form from a record type.
      Such applications can benefit from the guarantee that all
      fields of the record type in question have been
      considered.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="Ffc">&nbsp;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="firstclass">&nbsp;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="RECfirstclass">&nbsp;</a></p>
