      <h1>Data Serialization with S-Expressions</h1>

      <p>
	S-expressions are nested parenthetical expressions whose
	atomic values are strings. They were first popularized by the
	Lisp programming language in the 1960s. They have remained one
	of the simplest and most effective ways to encode structured
	data in a human-readable and editable form.

      <p>An example s-expression might look like this.</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/basic.scm"/>

      <p>
	S-expressions play a major role in Core, effectively acting as
	the default serialization format. Indeed, we've encountered
	s-expressions multiple times already, including
	in <a href="07-error-handling.html#error-handling" data-type="xref">Error
	Handling</a>, <a href="09-functors.html#functors" data-type="xref">Functors</a>,
	and <a href="10-first-class-modules.html#first-class-modules" data-type="xref">First Class Modules</a>.</p>

      <p>
	This chapter will go into s-expressions in more depth. In
	particular, we'll discuss:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>
          <p>
	    The details of the s-expression format, including how to
            parse it while generating good error messages for debugging
            malformed inputs</p>
	</li>

	<li>
          <p>
	    How to generate s-expressions from arbitrary OCaml
            types</p>
	</li>

	<li>
          <p>
	    How to use custom type annotations to control the exact
            printing behavior for s-expression converters</p>
	</li>

	<li>
          <p>
	    How to integrate s-expressions into your interfaces, in
            particular how to add s-expression converters to a module
            without breaking abstraction boundaries</p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	We'll tie this together at the end of the chapter with a
	simple s-expression formatted configuration file for a web
	server</p>

      <section id="basic-usage" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Basic Usage</h1>

	<p>
	  The type used to represent an s-expression is quite
	  simple:

	  <idx>s-expressions/basic usage of</idx></p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp.mli"/>

	<p>
	  An s-expression can be thought of as a tree where each
	  node contains a list of its children, and where the leaves of
	  the tree are strings. Core provides good support for
	  s-expressions in its <code>Sexp</code> module, including
	  functions for converting s-expressions to and from strings.
	  Let's rewrite our example s-expression in terms of this
	  type:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/print_sexp.mlt" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  This prints out nicely because Core registers a pretty
	  printer with the toplevel. This pretty printer is based on
	  the functions in <code>Sexp</code> for converting
	  s-expressions to and from strings:

	  <idx>pretty printers</idx></p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_printer.mlt" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  In addition to providing the <code>Sexp</code> module,
	  most of the base types in Core support conversion to and from
	  s-expressions. For example, we can use the conversion
	  functions defined in the respective modules for integers,
	  strings, and exceptions:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/to_from_sexp.mlt" part="0.5"/>

	<p>
	  It's also possible to convert more complex types such as
	  lists or arrays that are polymorphic across the types that
	  they can contain:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/to_from_sexp.mlt" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  Notice that <code>List.sexp_of_t</code> is polymorphic and
	  takes as its first argument another conversion function to
	  handle the elements of the list to be converted. Core uses
	  this scheme more generally for defining sexp converters for
	  polymorphic types.</p>

	<p>
	  The functions that go in the other direction,
	  <em>i.e.</em>, reconstruct an OCaml value from an
	  s-expression, use essentially the same trick for handling
	  polymorphic types, as shown in the following example. Note
	  that these functions will fail with an exception when
	  presented with an s-expression that doesn't match the
	  structure of the OCaml type in question.</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/to_from_sexp.mlt" part="2"/>

	<div data-type="note">
          <h1>More on Top-Level Printing</h1>

          <p>
	    The values of the s-expressions that we created were
            printed properly as s-expressions in the toplevel, instead
            of as the tree of <code>Atom</code> and <code>List</code>
            variants that they're actually made of.

	    <idx>top-level printers</idx></p>

          <p>
	    This is due to OCaml's facility for installing
            custom <em>top-level printers</em> that can rewrite some
            values into more top-level-friendly equivalents. They are
            generally installed
            as <span class="command"><em>ocamlfind</em></span>
            packages ending in <code>top</code>:</p>
	</div>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/list_top_packages.sh"/>

	<p>
	  The <code>core.top</code> package (which you should have
	  loaded by default in your <code>.ocamlinit</code> file) loads
	  in printers for the Core extensions already, so you don't
	  need to do anything special to use the s-expression
	  printer.</p>

	<section id="generating-s-expressions-from-ocaml-types" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>Generating S-Expressions from OCaml Types</h2>

          <p>
	    But what if you want a function to convert a brand new
            type to an s-expression? You can of course write it
            yourself manually. Here's an example:

	    <idx>s-expressions/generating from OCaml types</idx></p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/manually_making_sexp.mlt" part="1"/>

          <p>
	    This is somewhat tiresome to write, and it gets more so
            when you consider the parser, i.e., <code>t_of_sexp</code>,
            which is considerably more complex. Writing this kind of
            parsing and printing code by hand is mechanical and error
            prone, not to mention a drag.</p>

          <p>
	    Given how mechanical the code is, you could imagine
            writing a program that inspects the type definition and
            automatically generates the conversion code for you. As it
            turns out, there's a <em>syntax extension</em>
            called <code>ppx_sexp_conv</code> which does just that,
            creating the required functions for every type annotated
	    with <code>[@@deriving sexp]</code>.

	    <idx>Sexplib package/syntax extension in</idx>
	    <idx>syntax extension/in Sexplib package</idx></p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/auto_making_sexp.mlt" part="0.5"/>

          <p>
	    The syntax extension can be used outside of type
            declarations as well. As discussed
            in <a href="07-error-handling.html#error-handling"
            data-type="xref">Error Handling</a>, <code>with
            sexp</code> can be attached to the declaration of an
            exception, which will improve the ability of Core to
            generate a useful string representation:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/auto_making_sexp.mlt" part="1"/>

          <p>
	    You don't always have to declare a named type to create
            an s-expression converter. The following syntax lets you
            create one inline, as part of a larger expression:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/inline_sexp.mlt" part="1"/>

          <p>
	    The declaration <code>[%sexp_of: int * string]</code>
	    simply gets expanded to the sexp
            converter for the type <code>int * string</code>. This is
            useful whenever you need a sexp converter for an anonymous
            type.</p>

          <p>
	    The syntax extensions bundled with Core almost all have
            the same basic structure: they autogenerate code based on
            type definitions, implementing functionality that you could
            in theory have implemented by hand, but with far less
            programmer effort.</p>

          <div data-type="note">
            <h1>Syntax Extensions and PPX</h1>

            <p>
	      OCaml doesn't directly support deriving s-expression
	      converters from type definitions. Instead, it provides a
              mechanism called <em>PPX</em> which allows you to add to
              the compilation pipeline code for transforming OCaml
              programs at the syntactic level, via
              the <code>-ppx</code> compiler flag.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      PPXs operate on OCaml's <em>abstract syntax tree</em>,
	      or AST, which is a data type that represents the syntax
	      of a well-formed OCaml program. Annotations
	      like <code>[%sexp_of: int]</code> or <code>[@@deriving
	      sexp]</code> are part of special extensions to the
	      syntax, called <em>extension points</em>, which were
	      added to the language to give a place to put information
	      that would be consumed by syntax extensions
	      like <code>ppx_sexp_conv</code>.

      <section id="the-sexp-format" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>The Sexp Format</h1>

	<p>
	  The textual representation of s-expressions is pretty
	  straightforward. An s-expression is written down as a nested
	  parenthetical expression, with whitespace-separated strings
	  as the atoms. Quotes are used for atoms that contain
	  parentheses or spaces themselves; backslash is the escape
	  character; and semicolons are used to introduce single-line
	  comments. Thus, the following
	  file, <em class="filename">example.scm</em>:

	  <idx>s-expressions/format of</idx></p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/example.scm"/>

	<p>
	  can be loaded using Sexplib. As you can see, the commented
	  data is not part of the resulting s-expression:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/example_load.mlt" part="0.5"/>

	<p>
	  All in, the s-expression format supports three comment
	  syntaxes:</p>

	<dl>
          <dt><code>;</code></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>
	      Comments out everything to the end of line</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><code>#|,|#</code></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>
	      Delimiters for commenting out a block</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><code>#;</code></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>
	      Comments out the first complete s-expression that
              follows</p>
          </dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
	  The following example shows all of these in action:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/comment_heavy.scm"/>

	<p>
	  Again, loading the file as an s-expression drops the
	  comments:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/example_load.mlt" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  If we introduce an error into our s-expression, by, say,
	  creating a file <code>broken_example.scm</code> which is
	  <code>example.scm</code>, without open-paren in front of
	  <code>bar</code>, we'll get a parse error:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/example_load.mlt" part="2"/>

	<p>
	  In the preceding example, we use
	  <code>Exn.handle_uncaught</code> to make sure that the
	  exception gets printed out in full detail. You should
	  generally wrap every Core program in this handler to get good
	  error messages for any unexpected exceptions.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="preserving-invariants" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Preserving Invariants</h1>

	<p>
	  The most important functionality provided by Sexplib is the
	  autogeneration of converters for new types. We've seen a bit
	  of how this works already, but let's walk through a complete
	  example. Here's the source for a simple library for
	  representing integer intervals, very similar to the one
	  described in <a href="09-functors.html#functors" data-type="xref">Functors</a>:

	  <idx>s-expressions/preserving invariants in</idx></p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/test_interval/int_interval.ml"/>

	<p>
	  We can now use this module as follows:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/test_interval/test_interval.ml"/>

	<p>
	  But we're still missing something: we haven't created an
	  <code>mli</code> signature for <code>Int_interval</code> yet.
	  Note that we need to explicitly export the s-expression
	  converters that were created within the <code>ml</code> file.
	  For example, here's an interface that doesn't export the
	  s-expression functions:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/int_interval_nosexp.mli"/>

	<p>
	  Building this will give us the following error:</p>
  <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/test_interval_nosexp/jbuild"/>
	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/test_interval_nosexp/build_test_interval_nosexp.errsh"/>

	<p>
	  We could export the types by hand in the signature, by
	  writing the signatures for the extra functions generated by
	  Sexplib:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/int_interval_manual_sexp.mli"/>

	<p>
	  This isn't an ideal solution, as it makes you repeatedly
	  expose these extra functions in every signature you create
	  where you want to serialize values. Sexplib solves this by
	  exposing the same syntax extension in signature definitions
	  so that we can just use the same <code>with</code> shorthand
	  in the <code>mli</code> file. Here's the final version of the
	  signature that does just this:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/test_interval/int_interval.mli"/>

	<p>
	  At this point, <code>test_interval.ml</code> will compile
	  again, and if we run it, we'll get the following output:</p>
  <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/test_interval/jbuild"/>
	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/test_interval/build_test_interval.sh"/>

	<p>
	  One easy mistake to make when dealing with sexp converters
	  is to ignore the fact that those converters can violate the
	  invariants of your code. For example, the
	  <code>Int_interval</code> module depends for the correctness
	  of the <code>is_empty</code> check on the fact that for any
	  value <code>Range (x,y)</code>, <code>y</code> is greater
	  than or equal to <code>x</code>. The <code>create</code>
	  function preserves this invariant, but the
	  <code>t_of_sexp</code> function does not.

	  <idx>invariant checks</idx></p>

	<p>
	  We can fix this problem by overriding the autogenerated
	  function and writing a custom sexp converter that wraps the
	  autogenerated converter with whatever invariant checks are
	  necessary:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_override.ml"/>

	<p>
	  This trick of overriding an existing function definition
	  with a new one is perfectly acceptable in OCaml. Since
	  <code>t_of_sexp</code> is defined with an ordinary
	  <code>let</code> rather than a <code>let rec</code>, the call
	  to the <code>t_of_sexp</code> goes to the Sexplib-generated
	  version of the function, rather than being a recursive
	  call.</p>

	<p>
	  Another important aspect of our definition is that we call
	  the function <code>of_sexp_error</code> to raise an exception
	  when the parsing process fails. This improves the error
	  reporting that Sexplib can provide when a conversion fails,
	  as we'll see in the next section.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="getting-good-error-messages" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Getting Good Error Messages</h1>

	<p>
	  There are two steps to deserializing a type from an
	  s-expression: first, converting the bytes in a file to an
	  s-expression; and the second, converting that s-expression
	  into the type in question. One problem with this is that it
	  can be hard to localize errors to the right place using this
	  scheme. Consider the following example:

	  <idx>debugging/s-expressions</idx>
	  <idx>errors/error messages with s-expressions</idx>
	  <idx>s-expressions/deserializing a type from</idx></p>
  <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/read_foo/jbuild"/>
	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/read_foo/read_foo.ml"/>

	<p>
	  If you were to run this on a malformatted file, say, this
	  one:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/read_foo/foo_broken_example.scm"/>

	<p>
	  you'll get the following error:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/read_foo/build_read_foo.errsh"/>

	<p>
	  If all you have is the error message and the string, it's
	  not terribly informative. In particular, you know that the
	  parsing errored out on the atom "not-an-integer," but you
	  don't know which one! In a large file, this kind of bad error
	  message can be pure misery.</p>

	<p>
	  But there's hope! We can make a small change to the code
	  to improve the error message greatly:</p>
  <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/read_foo_better_errors/jbuild"/>
	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/read_foo_better_errors/read_foo_better_errors.ml"/>

	<p>
	  If we run it again, we'll see a much more specific
	  error:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/read_foo_better_errors/build_read_foo_better_errors.errsh"/>

	<p>
	  In the preceding
	  error, <code class="computeroutput">foo_broken_example.scm:2:5</code>
	  tells us that the error occurred in the
	  file <code class="computeroutput">"foo_broken_example.scm"</code>
	  on line 2, character 5. This is a much better start for
	  figuring out what went wrong. The ability to find the
	  precise location of the error depends on the sexp converter
	  reporting errors using the
	  function <code>of_sexp_error</code>. This is already done by
	  converters generated by Sexplib, but you should make sure to
	  do the same when you write custom converters.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="sexp-conversion-directives" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Sexp-Conversion Directives</h1>

	<p>
	  Sexplib supports a collection of directives for modifying
	  the default behavior of the autogenerated sexp converters.
	  These directives allow you to customize the way in which
	  types are represented as s-expressions without having to
	  write a custom converter.

	  <idx>s-expressions/modifying default behavior of</idx></p>

	<p>
	  Note that the extra directives aren't part of the standard
	  OCaml syntax, but are added via the Sexplib syntax
	  extension.  However, since Sexplib is used throughout Core
	  and is part of the standard bundle activated
	  by <span class="command"><em>corebuild</em></span>, you can
	  use these in your own Core code without any special
	  effort.</p>

	<section id="sexp_opaque" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>sexp_opaque</h2>

          <p>
	    The most commonly used directive is
            <code>sexp_opaque</code>, whose purpose is to mark a given
            component of a type as being unconvertible. Anything marked
            with <code>sexp_opaque</code> will be presented as the atom
            <code>&lt;opaque&gt;</code> by the to-sexp converter, and
            will trigger an exception from the from-sexp converter.

	    <idx>Sexplib package/sexp_opaque</idx></p>

          <p>
	    Note that the type of a component marked as opaque
            doesn't need to have a sexp converter defined. Here, if we
            define a type without a sexp converter and then try to use
            another type with a sexp converter, we'll error out:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_opaque.mlt" part="0.5"/>

          <p>
	    But with <code>sexp_opaque</code>, we can embed our
            opaque <code>no_converter</code> type within the other data
            structure without an error.</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_opaque.mlt" part="1"/>

          <p>
	    And if we now convert a value of this type to an
            s-expression, we'll see the contents of field
            <code>a</code> marked as opaque:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_opaque.mlt" part="2"/>

          <p>
	    Note that the <code>t_of_sexp</code> function for an
            opaque type is generated, but will fail at runtime if it is
            used:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_opaque.mlt" part="3"/>

          <p>
	    This is there to allow for s-expression converters to be
            created for types containing <code>sexp_opaque</code>
            values. This is useful because the resulting converters
            won't necessarily fail on all inputs. For example, if you
            have a record containing a <code>no_converter list</code>,
            the <code>t_of_sexp</code> function would still succeed
            when the list is empty:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_opaque.mlt" part="4"/>

          <p>
	    If you really only want to generate one direction of
            converter, one can do this by annotating the type with
            <code>[@@deriving sexp_of]</code> or <code>[@@deriving of_sexp]</code>
            instead of <code>[@@deriving sexp]</code>:</p>

	<section id="sexp_list" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>sexp_list</h2>

          <p>
	    Sometimes, sexp converters have more parentheses than
            one would ideally like. Consider, for example, the
            following variant type:

	    <idx>Sexplib package/sexp_list</idx></p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_list.mlt" part="0.5"/>

          <p>
	    You might prefer to make the syntax a bit less
            parenthesis-laden by dropping the parentheses around the
            list. We can replace the <code>string list</code> in the
            type declaration with <code>string sexp_list</code> to give
            us this alternate syntax:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_list.mlt" part="1"/>

	<section id="sexp_option" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>sexp_option</h2>

          <p>
	    Another common directive is <code>sexp_option</code>,
            which is used to make a record field optional in the
            s-expression. Normally, optional values are represented
            either as <code>()</code> for <code>None</code>, or as
            <code>(x)</code> for <code>Some x</code>, and a record
            field containing an option would be rendered accordingly.
            For example:

	    <idx>Sexplib package/sexp_option</idx></p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_option.mlt" part="0.5"/>

          <p>
	    But what if we want a field to be optional, i.e., we
            want to allow it to be omitted from the record entirely? In
            that case, we can mark it with
            <code>sexp_option</code>:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_option.mlt" part="1"/>

	<section id="specifying-defaults" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>Specifying Defaults</h2>

          <p>
	    The <code>sexp_option</code> declaration is really just
            an example of specifying a default behavior for dealing
            with an unspecified field. In particular,
            <code>sexp_option</code> fills in absent fields with
            <code>None</code>. But you might want to allow other ways
            of filling in default values.

	    <idx>s-expressions/specifying defaults in</idx></p>

          <p>
	    Consider the following type, which represents the
            configuration of a very simple web server:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_default.mlt" part="0.5"/>

          <p>
	    One could imagine making some of these parameters
            optional; in particular, by default, we might want the web
            server to bind to port 80, and to listen as localhost. We
            can do this as follows:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_default.mlt" part="1"/>

          <p>
	    Now, if we try to convert an s-expression that specifies
            only the <code>web_root</code>, we'll see that the other
            values are filled in with the desired defaults:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_default.mlt" part="2"/>

          <p>
	    If we convert the configuration back out to an
            s-expression, you'll notice that all of the fields are
            present, even though they're not strictly necessary:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_default.mlt" part="3"/>

          <p>
	    We could make the generated s-expression also drop
            exported values, by using the
            <code>sexp_drop_default</code> directive:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_default.mlt" part="4"/>

          <p>
	    As you can see, the fields that are at their default
            values are simply omitted from the s-expression. On the
            other hand, if we convert a config with other values, then
            those values will be included in the s-expression:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/sexpr/sexp_default.mlt" part="5"/>

          <p>
	    This can be very useful in designing config file formats
            that are both reasonably terse and easy to generate and
            maintain. It can also be useful for backwards
            compatibility: if you add a new field to your config
            record, but you make that field optional, then you should
            still be able to parse older version of your config.
