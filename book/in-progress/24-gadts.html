    <h1>Generalized Algebraic Data Types</h1>

    <p>
      OCaml's variants, which we discussed
      in <a href="06-variants.html#variants" data-type="xref">Chapter
	6</a>, are a powerful tool for representing data that can take
      on multiple different forms.  But variants have some important
      limitations in terms of how precise they are about enumerating
      these possibilities.  In this chapter, we'll
      discuss <em>generalized algebraic data types</em>, or GADTs, a
      generalization of variants which provide extra power, in
      exchange for some extra complexity.</p>

    <p>
      But before we explain what GADTs are, let's look at an example
      where they come in handy: building a more compact array type. </p>

    <section id="compact-array" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>Building a compact array</h1>

      <p>
	We haven't talked much about memory representations thus far
	(we'll get to that in more depth in
	<a href="20-runtime-memory-layout.html" data-type="xref">Chapter 20</a>), 
	but for now it suffices to note that
	OCaml's <code>array</code> type requires at least a word (and
	so 8 bytes on a 64-bit machine) of memory per element.  This
	is true even for objects that should in principle be small
	enough to fit in a single byte, like characters.  OCaml also
	has a more compact array-like type called <code>bytes</code>,
	which stores elements of type <code>char</code> and which only
	require a single byte per element. </p>

      <p>
	Despite the similarities, the <code>array</code>
	and <code>bytes</code> types are entirely distinct from
	OCaml's perspective, which means that you can't use them
	polymorphically.  In other words, you can't write a function
	that transparently works on either an <code>array</code> or
	a <code>bytes</code>, despite their similarities.
      </p>

      <p>
	So, how do we build a more general array type that supports
	using a more compact representation when what you're storing
	is characters, and which uses more general <code>array</code>
	representation otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
	Given that what we want is to support two different possible
	representations, variants seem like a natural choice.</p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/gadts/main.mlt" part="1"/>

      <p> 
	At first glance, this looks good: the type is polymorphic, and
	it has the two representations we're looking for.  But if we
	take this type and fill out the functions we'd need for a useful
	library, we start running into problems.
      </p>

      <link rel="import" href="code/gadts/main.mlt" part="1.1"/>

      <p>
	If you look closely, you'll see that the inferred types of this
	module are not what you'd hope for.  The first worrisome note is
	that the type of <code>of_bytes</code> is too general.  It
	should return <code>char t</code>, but returns <code>'a t</code>
	instead.
      </p>

      <p>
	On the other hand, the types of <code>get</code>
	and <code>set</code> are too specific, only allowing us to
	operate on <code>char t</code>s.  This follows from how OCaml's
	type inference works.  Consider the <code>match</code> statement
	in the code for <code>get</code>.  Normally, when OCaml
	considers a match statement, it requires that the value returned
	by every branch be of the same type.  Given that the second
	branch is specialized to <code>char</code>, all branches of the
	match must be too. </p>
      
      <p>
	Given that our accessors only apply to values of type `char
	t`, what we've essentially done is build a container for
	characters that can use either an <code>array</code>
	or <code>bytes</code> as its store.  That just doesn't solve
	our problem. </p>

      <section id="gadts-to-the-rescue" data-type="sect2">
	<h2>GADTs to the rescue</h2>

	<p>
	  As we'll see, the problem here is that variants aren't quite
	  expressive enough for our purposes.  Consider the code
	  for <code>get</code> above.  Because <code>get</code> is
	  polymorphic, the type of <code>t</code> must be <code>'a
	    t</code>, where <code>'a</code> can be instantiated at any
	  type.  But once we get into the body of the different cases of
	  the match statement, things are different.  If we're in the
	  <code>Array</code> case, we still want the freedom
	  for <code>'a</code> to be of any type; but in
	  the <code>Bytes</code> case, the type variable <code>'a</code>
	  can only be <code>char</code>.</p>
	
	<p>
	  Effectively, we need to be able to <em>refine</em> the type
	  parameter of <code>t</code> when we get into the individual
	  cases of the match, and htis is precisely what GADTs let us
	  do.</p>

	<p>
	  GADTs are more general than variant types, so let's start by
	  rewriting our broken implementation using the language of
	  GADTs, but without actually fixing our core problem.</p>
