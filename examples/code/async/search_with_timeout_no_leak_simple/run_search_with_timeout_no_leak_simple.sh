  concurrent programming
  ----------------------
  
  "Concurrent computing is a form of computing in which several
  computations are executed during overlapping time
  periods—concurrently—instead of sequentially. This is a property
  of a system—this may be an individual program, a computer, or a
  network—and there is a separate execution point or \"thread of
  control\" for each computation. A concurrent system is one where a
  computation can advance without waiting for all other computations to
  complete."
  
  ocaml

  "OCaml, originally named Objective Caml, is the main implementation of
  the programming language Caml, created by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme
  Vouillon, Damien Doligez, Didier Rémy, Ascánder Suárez and others
  in 1996. A member of the ML language family, OCaml extends the core
  Caml language with object-oriented programming constructs."
